# Epic 2: Dashboard Core Functionality

**Status:** To Do

**Parent PRD Sections:** 
*   3.5.1 Dashboard (Customizable widgets, Real-time market data, AI insights panel, Portfolio overview, Alert management)
*   3.2 AI and Analysis Engine (Display of AI insights)
*   3.4 Performance Monitoring (Real-time analytics on dashboard)

**Goal:** To provide users with a comprehensive, customizable, and real-time dashboard that serves as their central hub for monitoring their portfolio, tracking market data, receiving AI-driven insights, and managing alerts.

**Scope:**
*   Display of core portfolio summary (e.g., total value, today's P&L).
    *   **AI Consideration:** Potential for an AI Portfolio Analysis Agent to provide textual summaries or context.
*   Implementation of a customizable widget system (add, remove, rearrange widgets).
*   Development of initial standard widgets:
    *   Portfolio Value Chart (AI context from Portfolio Analysis Agent).
    *   Watchlist (AI monitoring and insights from a dedicated Watchlist AI Agent).
    *   Top Market Movers (Potential for AI to explain *why* they are moving).
    *   AI Insights Panel (Primary interface for a dedicated Market Insights AI Agent using RAG).
    *   Active Alerts Summary (Potential for AI Alert Suggestion Agent to help create alerts).
*   Integration of real-time data streams for relevant widgets.
*   Mechanism for managing user-specific widget configurations.

**AI Integration Points:**
*   **Market Insights AI Agent:** Powers the AI Insights Panel, providing proactive and reactive (NLQ-based) financial information, news summaries, and market analysis using RAG.
*   **Portfolio Analysis AI Agent:** Provides contextual explanations and summaries for portfolio snapshots and value charts. May use RAG for financial literacy explanations.
*   **Watchlist Monitoring AI Agent:** Actively monitors watchlist items, providing smart notifications and RAG-based insights for specific stocks.
*   **Alert Suggestion AI Agent:** Assists users in creating relevant alerts based on their holdings, watchlist, or common strategies, potentially using RAG.

**Key Business Value:** 
*   Enhances user engagement by providing a personalized and relevant overview.
*   Improves decision-making through readily available real-time data and AI insights.
*   Increases platform utility by centralizing key information.
