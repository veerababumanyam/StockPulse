# MCP Federation and Dynamic Discovery Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for implementing federation and dynamic discovery capabilities for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration in StockPulse. The federation system will allow StockPulse to function as both an MCP client and server within a larger ecosystem of MCP-enabled applications and services.

## 1. Federation Registry Architecture

### 1.1 Core Components

The federation registry will consist of the following components:

- **Registry Service**: A centralized service that maintains metadata about available MCP servers
- **Discovery Protocol**: A standardized mechanism for discovering and connecting to MCP servers
- **Capability Catalog**: A structured representation of available tools and capabilities
- **Authentication Framework**: OAuth 2.0-based authentication for secure server access
- **Validation Service**: Automated validation of MCP server compliance

### 1.2 Registry Data Model

Each MCP server entry in the registry will include:

- **Server ID**: Unique identifier for the MCP server
- **Server Name**: Human-readable name
- **Description**: Detailed description of server purpose and capabilities
- **URL Endpoint**: Base URL for connecting to the server
- **Capabilities**: List of available tools and functions
- **Version**: Server version information
- **Authentication Requirements**: OAuth scopes and requirements
- **Status**: Active, maintenance, deprecated
- **Metadata**: Tags, categories, usage statistics
- **Owner**: Organization or individual responsible for the server
- **Creation/Update Timestamps**: When the server was registered/updated

### 1.3 Global Public API

The federation registry will expose a RESTful API with the following endpoints:

```
GET /api/v1/servers                # List all registered servers
GET /api/v1/servers/{id}           # Get details for a specific server
GET /api/v1/servers/search         # Search servers by capability/category
POST /api/v1/servers               # Register a new server
PUT /api/v1/servers/{id}           # Update server information
DELETE /api/v1/servers/{id}        # Remove a server from the registry
GET /api/v1/servers/{id}/status    # Check server health/status
GET /api/v1/capabilities           # List all available capabilities
GET /api/v1/categories             # List all server categories
```

## 2. Dynamic Discovery Protocol

### 2.1 Discovery Mechanisms

The dynamic discovery protocol will support multiple discovery mechanisms:

1. **Registry-based Discovery**: Query the federation registry for servers matching specific criteria
2. **Network-based Discovery**: Discover MCP servers on the local network using mDNS/DNS-SD
3. **URL-based Discovery**: Connect directly to a known MCP server URL
4. **QR Code/Deep Link Discovery**: Scan QR codes or follow deep links to connect to servers

### 2.2 Discovery Protocol Flow

1. **Initialization**: Client initializes discovery with capability requirements
2. **Query**: Client queries registry or network for matching servers
3. **Response**: Registry returns list of matching servers with metadata
4. **Selection**: Client selects appropriate server based on capabilities, trust, etc.
5. **Connection**: Client establishes connection to selected server
6. **Capability Verification**: Client verifies server capabilities match requirements
7. **Authentication**: Client authenticates with server using OAuth 2.0
8. **Session Establishment**: Secure session established for ongoing communication

### 2.3 Capability Matching

The discovery protocol will include a capability matching algorithm that:

- Matches client requirements against server capabilities
- Considers version compatibility
- Evaluates authentication requirements
- Factors in performance metrics and reliability
- Applies user preferences and trusted sources

## 3. Security and Trust Model

### 3.1 Authentication and Authorization

- OAuth 2.0 for authentication between clients and servers
- JWT tokens for secure session management
- Granular permission model for capability access
- Rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse

### 3.2 Trust Verification

- Digital signatures for server verification
- Certificate-based trust chain
- Reputation scoring based on usage and feedback
- Automated security scanning of registered servers

### 3.3 Privacy Considerations

- Data minimization in registry entries
- User consent for server connections
- Transparency in capability usage
- Audit logging of all federation activities

## 4. Implementation Architecture

### 4.1 Server-Side Components

- **Registry Database**: Stores server metadata and capabilities
- **API Gateway**: Handles registry API requests
- **Discovery Service**: Implements discovery protocol
- **Validation Service**: Verifies server compliance
- **Monitoring Service**: Tracks server health and statistics

### 4.2 Client-Side Components

- **Discovery Client**: Implements discovery protocol for finding servers
- **Connection Manager**: Handles server connections and session management
- **Capability Cache**: Caches discovered server capabilities
- **Authentication Manager**: Manages OAuth tokens and authentication
- **Preference Manager**: Stores user preferences for server selection

### 4.3 Integration with StockPulse

The federation and discovery components will integrate with StockPulse through:

- **MCP Client Module**: For discovering and connecting to external MCP servers
- **MCP Server Module**: For registering StockPulse capabilities with the federation
- **UI Components**: For managing federation settings and server connections
- **Security Framework**: For handling authentication and authorization

## 5. User Experience

### 5.1 Server Discovery and Connection

- Visual server browser with filtering and search
- Capability-based server recommendations
- One-click connection to trusted servers
- QR code scanning for quick connections
- Connection history and favorites

### 5.2 Server Management

- Server health monitoring dashboard
- Usage statistics and performance metrics
- Connection troubleshooting tools
- Server capability exploration
- Authentication management

## 6. Implementation Plan

### 6.1 Phase 1: Core Federation Registry

- Implement registry data model and database
- Develop basic REST API for server registration and discovery
- Create simple server browser UI
- Implement basic authentication

### 6.2 Phase 2: Enhanced Discovery Protocol

- Implement capability matching algorithm

- Develop QR code/deep link discovery
- Enhance security with digital signatures

### 6.3 Phase 3: Advanced Features

- Add reputation scoring and feedback
- Implement automated compliance checking
- Develop performance monitoring
- Create advanced server browser with analytics

## 7. Best Practices

### 7.1 Registry Management

- Regular validation of registered servers
- Automated health checks
- Version compatibility tracking
- Deprecation policies for outdated servers

### 7.2 Discovery Optimization

- Capability caching for performance
- Intelligent server selection based on latency and load
- Fallback mechanisms for unavailable servers
- Batch discovery for multiple capabilities

### 7.3 Security Considerations

- Regular security audits of registry

- Capability composition across multiple servers
- Predictive discovery based on user behavior

## 9. Conclusion

The federation and dynamic discovery design outlined in this document provides a comprehensive framework for integrating StockPulse into the broader MCP ecosystem. By implementing these capabilities, StockPulse will be able to seamlessly discover and connect to external MCP servers while also making its own capabilities available to other applications.
