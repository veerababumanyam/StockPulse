# Epic 10: Backend - Platform Administration & Observability (Platform Epic)

**Status:** To Do

**Parent PRD Sections:**

- `PRD.md#4.3` (System Administration & Monitoring)
- `PRD.md#3.2.3` (AI Infrastructure - monitoring AI agents)

**Goal:** To develop backend systems and interfaces for platform administration, including user management, system health monitoring, AI agent observability, and management of data sources and configurations.

**Scope:**

- **Admin Dashboard:** A secure web interface for platform administrators.
- **User Management:** Admin capabilities to view user accounts, manage roles/permissions (if applicable), and assist with account issues (e.g., password resets, unlocking accounts if Fraud Detection Agent flags them).
- **System Health Monitoring:** Dashboards and alerts for core system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network), database performance (`StockPulse_PostgreSQL`, `StockPulse_Redis`, `StockPulse_VectorDB`, `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`), API response times, and error rates.
- **AI Agent Observability & Monitoring:**
  - Tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) for each AI agent (e.g., query volume, response time, error rates, feedback scores from Epic 7).
  - Logging AI agent decisions and internal states (for debugging and analysis, more detailed than user-facing logs in Epic 7).
  - Alerts for AI agent failures or performance degradation.
  - Tools for A2A communication monitoring: tracing message flows, identifying bottlenecks or failures in agent interactions (Google A2A protocol focus).
- **Data Source Management:** Admin interface to monitor status of data ingestion pipelines (from Epic 6: Data Sources & Market Integration), view data source health, and potentially manually trigger updates or re-indexing for RAG KBs.
- **Configuration Management:** Secure way to manage system configurations, API keys for external services, and AI model parameters.
- **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive logging of administrative actions and key system events for security and compliance.

**AI Integration Points:**

- AI can be used for anomaly detection in system logs or AI agent performance metrics, proactively alerting administrators to potential issues.
- AI could assist in analyzing audit logs to identify suspicious patterns.

**Key Business Value:**

- Ensures platform stability, reliability, and performance.
- Provides administrators with the tools needed to manage the platform and support users effectively.
- Enables proactive monitoring and troubleshooting of AI agents and their dependencies.
- Supports security and compliance requirements through robust logging and administration tools.

## Stories Under this Epic:

- **10.1:** Develop Secure Admin Dashboard with Role-Based Access Control.
- **10.2:** Implement User Management Interface for Administrators (View, Assist, Role Mgmt).
- **10.3:** Setup System Health Monitoring Dashboards & Alerting for Core Infrastructure.
- **10.4:** Create AI Agent Performance & Observability Monitoring Dashboard.
- **10.5:** Build Data Source Management UI (Status, Manual Triggers for Epic 6 pipelines).
- **10.6:** Implement Secure Configuration Management System for API Keys & Parameters.
- **10.7:** Develop Comprehensive Audit Logging for Administrative & Key System Actions.
- **10.8 (Future):** Integrate AI for Anomaly Detection in System/Performance Logs.

## Dependencies:

- All other epics, as this involves monitoring and managing the entire platform.
- Epic 6 (Data Sources & Market Integration) for data pipeline information.
- Epic 7 (AI Agent Interaction & Personalization) for AI agent KPIs.
- Logging frameworks and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack or cloud equivalents).
- Secure authentication and authorization for the Admin Dashboard.
- Defined A2A communication protocols to enable their monitoring.

## Notes & Assumptions:

- This is a critical backend and infrastructure epic for platform operation.
- Requires careful consideration of security for all admin functions.

## Future Scope:

- AI-powered predictive maintenance for infrastructure.
- Automated scaling recommendations based on AI analysis of load patterns.
- More sophisticated AI-driven root cause analysis for platform issues.
