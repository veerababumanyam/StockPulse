**Goal:** To implement advanced memory architectures and context management systems that enable StockPulse AI agents to maintain comprehensive, long-term understanding of users, markets, and relationships, while supporting cross-domain reasoning capabilities essential for AGI development.

**Scope:**
*   **Advanced Memory Architecture:** Multi-layered memory systems including working memory, episodic memory, semantic memory, and procedural memory that mirror human cognitive structures.
*   **Context Preservation Systems:** Maintain comprehensive context across user sessions, market conditions, and time periods to enable consistent and informed decision-making.
*   **Cross-Domain Knowledge Integration:** Systems that connect and apply knowledge across different domains (finance, psychology, economics, technology) for holistic understanding.
*   **Temporal Reasoning Capabilities:** Understanding and reasoning about time-dependent relationships, patterns, and cause-effect chains across extended periods.
*   **Relationship and Entity Memory:** Comprehensive tracking of relationships between entities (users, stocks, markets, events) and their evolving characteristics.
*   **Massive-Scale Context Management:** Efficient handling of diverse, large-scale datasets for AGI-level context understanding as mentioned in the research.

**AGI Memory Integration Points:**
*   **Hierarchical Memory System:** Multiple memory levels from immediate working memory to long-term semantic knowledge storage.
*   **Associative Memory Networks:** Connection and retrieval systems that mirror human associative thinking and memory recall.
*   **Contextual Vector Embeddings:** Advanced vector representations that capture rich contextual and relational information.
*   **Temporal Memory Graphs:** Time-aware knowledge graphs that track how relationships and entities evolve over time.
*   **Multi-Modal Memory:** Integration of textual, numerical, temporal, and pattern-based memories for comprehensive understanding.
*   **Memory Consolidation Processes:** Systems that strengthen important memories while allowing less relevant information to fade.

**Key Business Value:**
*   **Deeper Understanding:** Comprehensive memory enables more sophisticated and personalized insights.
*   **Consistent Experience:** Users experience AI that remembers and builds upon past interactions.
*   **Strategic Reasoning:** Long-term memory enables strategic thinking and planning capabilities.
*   **Cross-Domain Insights:** Connections between different knowledge areas provide unique competitive advantages.
