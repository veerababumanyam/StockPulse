# Epic 1: Core User Authentication and Account Setup

**Status:** To Do

**Parent PRD Sections:** 
*   3.5.1 Dashboard (Authentication is a prerequisite)
*   4.1 Technology Stack (Frontend: React, TypeScript; Backend: Node.js for Auth)
*   4.3 Security Requirements (Authentication, Authorization, Data Encryption)
*   5.1 Beginner Trader (Needs account)
*   5.2 Experienced Trader (Needs account)

**Goal:** To enable new users to securely register for a StockPulse account, existing users to log in, and manage basic aspects of their account, forming the foundational layer for accessing all platform features.

**Scope:**
*   User Registration (Email/Password)
    *   **AI Consideration:** Integration with an AI-Powered Fraud Detection Agent to analyze and flag suspicious sign-ups.
*   User Login (Email/Password)
*   Secure Password Storage (Backend Responsibility)
*   Basic Session Management (Frontend & Backend)
*   Password Reset Functionality (Phase 1.5 or 2 - for now, note as out of initial MVP for this epic unless specified)
*   Basic User Profile/Settings Page placeholder (Details in a separate epic/story)

**AI Integration Points:**
*   **AI-Powered Fraud Detection Agent:** To be invoked during the registration process. This agent will utilize RAG with a knowledge base of fraud patterns and potentially external data sources to assess risk.

**Key Business Value:** 
*   Enables user acquisition.
*   Secures access to the platform.
*   Foundation for personalized user experience.

    *   **Requirements:** (To be detailed in story file - will include RAG, VectorDB interaction, flagging mechanism)
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** (To be detailed in story file)
    *   **Status:** To Do

*More stories may be added as this epic is refined (e.g., for password reset, email verification if required early).* 

## Dependencies:

*   Backend authentication API endpoints (registration, login, session validation).
*   UI components for forms and user feedback.

## Notes & Assumptions:

*   Focus is on email/password authentication for this epic.
*   Advanced authentication methods (e.g., social login, MFA) will be separate epics/features.
*   Error handling should be comprehensive and user-friendly.
