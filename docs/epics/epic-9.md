- **AI-Guided Tutorials:** Interactive tutorials for platform features, guided by an AI agent that can answer contextual questions during the tutorial.
- **Glossary of Financial Terms:** Comprehensive, easily searchable glossary, with AI providing simplified explanations for complex terms.
- Contact support options (e.g., form, chat link if live support is implemented).

**AI Integration Points:**

- **AI Support Agent:**
  - Powers the RAG-based Help Center.
