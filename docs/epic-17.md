# Epic 17: Risk Management & Compliance

**Status:** To Do

**Parent PRD Sections:**
*   `PRD.md#3.11` (Security & Compliance)
*   `PRD.md#3.7` (AI-Driven Portfolio Optimization & Risk Analysis - specifically compliance aspects like suitability)
*   `PRD.md#1.4` (Target Audience - addressing institutional needs for compliance tooling if applicable)

**Goal:** To ensure the platform operates securely, meets regulatory compliance requirements, and provides users and the system itself with robust risk management tools and oversight.

**Scope:**
*   **User & System Security:**
    *   Advanced authentication mechanisms (MFA, biometric integration - building on Epic 1).
    *   Fraud detection systems (e.g., for unusual login activity, suspicious transactions) powered by an "AI Security Assist Agent".
    *   Data encryption at rest and in transit for all sensitive information.
    *   Regular security audits and penetration testing.
*   **Regulatory Compliance Tools:**
    *   Features to help users and the platform adhere to relevant financial regulations (e.g., KYC/AML checks during onboarding - extending Epic 1, trade reporting if applicable, suitability checks for investment recommendations).
    *   Audit trails for all significant user and system actions.
    *   Data retention policies and mechanisms.
*   **Trading Risk Management:**
    *   Pre-trade risk checks (e.g., margin requirements, order size limits, pattern day trader (PDT) warnings).
    *   Real-time portfolio risk monitoring (beyond analytics in Epic 8, focusing on limit breaches and critical alerts).
    *   Automated risk alerts to users (e.g., large drawdown, margin call warning).
    *   Potentially, system-level risk controls to manage overall platform exposure.
*   **AI Governance & Ethical AI:**
    *   Framework for monitoring AI agent behavior for fairness, bias, and adherence to ethical guidelines (links to AGI epics like Epic 13 but with immediate platform implications).
    *   Explainability features for AI-driven decisions where feasible and required (extending Story 7.5 concepts).

**AI Integration Points:**
*   **AI Security Assist Agent:** Detects anomalous user activity, potential fraud, and security threats.
*   **AI Compliance Monitoring Agent:** Could assist in monitoring trades for compliance with regulations (e.g., flagging potentially manipulative trading patterns) or ensuring AI recommendations meet suitability rules.
*   **AI Risk Alerting Agent:** Part of the AI Meta-Agent or a specialized agent that identifies and alerts on critical risk threshold breaches in user portfolios or system-wide.

**Key Business Value:**
*   Builds trust and confidence by prioritizing user security and data protection.
*   Ensures adherence to legal and regulatory obligations, reducing operational and reputational risk.
*   Provides users with tools to manage their trading risks effectively.
*   Supports responsible AI development and deployment.

## Stories Under this Epic:
*   **17.1:** Implement Advanced User Authentication & AI-Powered Fraud Detection.
*   **17.2:** Develop Comprehensive Audit Trail System for User & System Actions.
*   **17.3:** Integrate KYC/AML & Regulatory Reporting Framework.
*   **17.4:** Build Pre-Trade Risk Check Engine (Margin, Order Limits, PDT).
*   **17.5:** Implement Real-Time Portfolio Risk Monitoring & Alerting System.
*   **17.6 (Future):** Develop AI Model Governance & Bias Detection Framework (Platform-Specific Aspects).

## Dependencies:
*   Epic 1 (Core User Authentication) for foundational security.
*   Epic 5 (Trading & Order Management) for integrating pre-trade checks.
*   Epic 8 (Advanced Analytics & Insights) for risk data that might feed into monitoring.
*   Story 7.7 (AI Meta-Agent/Orchestrator Backend) for managing security/compliance AI agents.
*   Epic 13 (AGI Safety & Ethics Framework) for overarching principles.
*   Data storage for audit logs, compliance data (`StockPulse_PostgreSQL`).

## Notes & Assumptions:
*   Compliance requirements can vary significantly by jurisdiction; initial focus on common/critical aspects.
*   Robust security is an ongoing effort, not a one-time implementation.

## Future Scope:
*   More sophisticated AI-driven compliance checks (e.g., communications surveillance if chat features are added).
*   Formalized AI ethics board and review processes (platform-level liaison with AGI framework).
*   Integration with external regulatory reporting systems.
