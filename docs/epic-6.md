# Epic 6: Data Sources & Market Integration

**Status:** To Do

**Parent PRD Sections:**
*   `PRD.md#3.3` (Data Sources and Integration)
*   `PRD.md#4.5` (Data Quality & Reliability)
*   `PRD.md#4.6` (Scalability - for data ingestion)

**Goal:** To establish robust, reliable, and scalable integration with all necessary external and internal data sources, providing the foundational market, financial, and alternative data required for all platform functionalities, including AI analysis and trading operations.

**Scope:**
*   **Market Data Integration:** Real-time and historical price/volume data for equities, options, forex, and cryptocurrencies from multiple exchanges and providers (e.g., IEX Cloud, Polygon.io, Binance).
    *   Includes tick data, minute/hourly/daily bars, order book data (L1/L2).
*   **Fundamental Data Integration:** Company financials (income statements, balance sheets, cash flow), earnings reports, SEC filings, analyst ratings, corporate actions (dividends, splits).
*   **News & Sentiment Data Integration:** Real-time news feeds from various financial news providers, social media sentiment analysis data streams.
*   **Economic Data Integration:** Macroeconomic indicators, interest rates, inflation data, GDP, employment figures from government and private sources.
*   **Alternative Data Integration (Future Scope):** Satellite imagery, supply chain data, ESG data, etc., as deemed valuable.
*   **Internal Data Feeds:** Integration with internal data sources like user portfolio data for contextual analysis by AI agents.
*   **Data Ingestion Pipelines:** Design and implement resilient pipelines for fetching, validating, normalizing, and storing data in appropriate databases (`StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`, `StockPulse_PostgreSQL`, `StockPulse_VectorDB`).
*   **Data Quality Assurance:** Implement mechanisms for monitoring data quality, detecting anomalies, handling missing data, and ensuring accuracy.
*   **API Abstraction Layer:** Create an internal API layer to provide unified access to various data sources for platform services and AI agents.

**AI Integration Points:**
*   Data ingested through this epic is fundamental for all AI agents.
*   AI can be used for data quality monitoring and anomaly detection in ingestion pipelines.
*   AI can assist in normalizing and structuring unstructured data (e.g., news articles for sentiment analysis or event extraction for `StockPulse_VectorDB`).

**Key Business Value:**
*   Provides the core data foundation for the entire platform.
*   Ensures data accuracy, timeliness, and reliability critical for trading decisions and AI model performance.
*   Enables comprehensive market analysis and sophisticated AI-driven insights.
*   Scalable data infrastructure to support growth and new data types.

## Stories Under this Epic:
*   **6.1: Implement Real-Time Equity Price/Volume Data Feed Integration (e.g., IEX Cloud)**
*   **6.2: Implement Historical Equity Price/Volume Data Ingestion & Storage**
*   **6.3: Integrate Options Chain & Real-Time Options Data Feed**
*   **6.4: Integrate Forex & Cryptocurrency Real-Time Data Feeds**
*   **6.5: Implement Company Fundamental Data Integration (Financials, Filings)**
*   **6.6: Integrate Financial News Feeds & Basic Sentiment Scoring**
*   **6.7: Develop Data Ingestion Pipelines for Key Data Types with Monitoring**
*   **6.8: Implement Data Quality Assurance Framework (Initial Rules & Alerts)**
*   **6.9: Design & Implement Internal Data Access API Layer**
*   **6.10 (Future): Integrate Macroeconomic Data Feeds**

## Dependencies:
*   Core backend infrastructure (`StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`, `StockPulse_PostgreSQL`, `StockPulse_VectorDB`).
*   Potentially API keys and subscriptions for external data providers.
*   Defined data models and schemas.

## Notes & Assumptions:
*   Focus on a primary set of critical data sources initially, with ability to expand.
*   Data costs from providers need to be considered.
*   Compliance with data provider licensing terms is essential.

## Future Scope:
*   Integration with more exotic alternative data sources.
*   Advanced AI-driven data validation and imputation.
*   User-configurable data source preferences (if applicable).
