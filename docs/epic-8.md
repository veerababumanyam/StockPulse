# Epic 8: Advanced Analytics & Insights

**Status:** To Do

**Parent PRD Sections:**
*   `PRD.md#3.5` (Advanced Charting and Technical Analysis)
*   `PRD.md#3.6` (AI-Powered Predictive Analytics)
*   `PRD.md#3.7` (AI-Driven Portfolio Optimization & Risk Analysis)
*   `PRD.md#3.8` (Fundamental Analysis Tools - Advanced AI aspects)
*   `PRD.md#3.9` (Alternative Data Integration - AI aspects)

**Goal:** To provide users with sophisticated analytical tools and AI-driven insights to make more informed investment decisions, understand market dynamics, and analyze portfolio performance deeply.

**Scope:**
*   **Advanced Charting & Technical Analysis Tools:** Comprehensive charting with a wide array of technical indicators, drawing tools, and custom indicator support. AI can suggest relevant indicators or identify patterns.
*   **AI-Powered Portfolio Analysis & Optimization:** Deeper analysis of portfolio composition, risk exposure (e.g., VaR, stress testing), scenario modeling, and AI-driven suggestions for diversification or rebalancing based on user goals and risk tolerance.
*   **Predictive Analytics & Forecasting (AI-Driven):** AI models to generate probabilistic forecasts for stock prices, market trends, or volatility, clearly communicating uncertainties and confidence levels.
*   **AI-Generated Fundamental Analysis Summaries & Insights:** AI agents that can process company filings, earnings calls, and news to generate concise summaries of fundamental health, valuation insights, risks, and opportunities (extending capabilities from Epic 6).
*   **Alternative Data Integration & Analysis (Future Consideration):** Incorporating and analyzing alternative datasets (e.g., advanced sentiment analysis, ESG scores from specialized providers, supply chain data) for unique insights, with AI helping to extract signals.
*   **Customizable Analytics Dashboards:** Allow users to create personalized dashboards combining their preferred charts, metrics, AI insights, and reports.

**AI Integration Points:**
*   **AI Technical Pattern Recognition Agent:** Identifies chart patterns (e.g., head and shoulders, flags), suggests relevant technical indicators based on market conditions or user preferences.
*   **AI Portfolio Optimizer Agent:** Performs advanced risk analysis (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations, VaR calculations), suggests optimal asset allocations, identifies concentrated risks, and provides rebalancing recommendations.
*   **AI Forecasting Agent:** Generates probabilistic forecasts for equity prices, index movements, or sector trends using time-series models, machine learning, and potentially incorporating macroeconomic data.
*   **AI Fundamental Insights Agent:** Provides deeper dives than basic news summaries; e.g., comparative analysis of company fundamentals against peers, red flag identification in financial statements, summarization of key points from earnings call transcripts with sentiment analysis.
*   **AI Alternative Data Analyst Agent (Future):** Processes and extracts signals from non-traditional data sources when integrated.

**Key Business Value:**
*   Empowers users with professional-grade analytical capabilities, democratizing access to sophisticated tools.
*   Provides unique, actionable, AI-driven insights not readily available on standard platforms.
*   Helps users to better understand and manage investment risks and identify potential opportunities.
*   Increases platform stickiness and user engagement by offering indispensable analytical tools and personalized insights.
*   Differentiates StockPulse as a leader in AI-driven financial technology.

## Stories Under this Epic:
*   **8.1:** Implement Advanced Charting Module with AI-Suggested Indicators & Pattern Recognition.
*   **8.2:** Develop AI-Powered Portfolio Risk Analyzer (VaR, Stress Testing, Scenario Modeling).
*   **8.3:** Implement AI Portfolio Optimization & Rebalancing Advisor.
*   **8.4:** Create AI Forecasting Engine for Equity Prices & Market Trends.
*   **8.5:** Develop AI Agent for Deep Fundamental Analysis & Insights Generation (Earnings Calls, Filings).
*   **8.6:** Implement Customizable Analytics Dashboard Framework.
*   **8.7 (Future):** Integrate and Analyze [Specific Alternative Data Source] with AI.

## Dependencies:
*   Epic 6 (Data Sources & Market Integration) for foundational data feeds.
*   Story 6.9 (Internal Data Access API Layer) for AI agents to access data.
*   Story 7.7 (AI Meta-Agent/Orchestrator Backend) for managing these new AI analytical agents.
*   `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`, `StockPulse_PostgreSQL`, `StockPulse_VectorDB` for storing data, analyses, and model outputs.
*   Robust backend infrastructure for running complex AI models and computations.

## Notes & Assumptions:
*   Development of sophisticated AI models for forecasting and optimization is complex and iterative.
*   Transparency in how AI insights are generated and presentation of confidence levels/uncertainties are crucial.
*   Users will need education (Epic 7 / prior content of this Epic file) on how to interpret and use these advanced tools and AI insights.

## Future Scope:
*   Integration of more diverse alternative datasets.
*   AI-driven backtesting engines for user-defined strategies incorporating these tools.
*   Personalized AI-generated market commentary and research reports.
