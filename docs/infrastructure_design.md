# StockPulse Infrastructure Design

**Version:** 0.1
**Last Updated:** (Today's Date)

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the infrastructure design for the StockPulse platform, emphasizing its AI-driven capabilities, open-source database utilization, and robust, scalable architecture.

*(A high-level architecture diagram, potentially using Mermaid, will be added here once components are more defined)*

## 2. Guiding Principles

*   **AI-First:** Leverage AI agents and RAG to provide intelligent and proactive features.
*   **Open Source:** Prioritize well-supported open-source technologies, especially for databases.
*   **Scalability & Resilience:** Design for growth and fault tolerance.
*   **Security:** Implement security best practices at all layers.
*   **Modularity:** Encourage a microservices-oriented or well-encapsulated modular design for AI agents and backend services.
*   **Observability:** Ensure comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing.

## 3. Compute Layer

*   **Application Servers:** (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI - TBD based on service needs)
*   **AI Agent Services:** (May be separate microservices for computationally intensive agents)
*   **Containerization:** Docker for all services and databases.
*   **Orchestration:** (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm - TBD, consider managed K8s if cloud-hosted)

## 4. Data Layer

### 4.1. StockPulse_PostgreSQL (Relational Data)
    *   **Purpose:** Core transactional data: user profiles, accounts, orders, trades, portfolio holdings.
    *   **Engine:** PostgreSQL
    *   **Deployment:** Docker container.
    *   **Key Considerations:** Schema design, indexing, backups, replication.

### 4.2. StockPulse_Redis (Caching & Real-time)
    *   **Purpose:** Caching, session management, real-time notifications (order status, price alerts), message broker for inter-service/agent communication.
    *   **Engine:** Redis
    *   **Deployment:** Docker container.
    *   **Key Considerations:** Data persistence strategy, clustering for HA.

### 4.3. StockPulse_KnowledgeGraph (Graphiti/Neo4j)
    *   **Purpose:** Stores embeddings and interconnected data forming a knowledge graph for RAG-powered AI agents. Manages financial documents, news, market data, and application documentation, enabling dynamic updates, temporal tracking, and complex relationship queries.
    *   **Engine:** Graphiti (with Neo4j as the backend database)
    *   **Deployment:** Docker containers for Graphiti and Neo4j.
    *   **Key Considerations:** Neo4j administration and scaling, graph schema design, embedding generation pipeline, query performance, `graphiti`'s LLM compatibility (prefers structured output), real-time data ingestion and contradiction handling.

### 4.4. StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB (Time-Series Data)
    *   **Purpose:** Historical stock prices, technical indicators, user activity logs, system performance metrics.
    *   **Engine:** TBD (e.g., TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL extension), Prometheus, InfluxDB)
    *   **Deployment:** Docker container.
    *   **Key Considerations:** Data ingestion rates, query patterns, data retention policies.

## 5. AI/ML Layer

### 5.1. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Pipeline
    *   **Components:**
        *   Data Ingestion & Preprocessing
        *   Embedding Generation (e.g., using Sentence Transformers, OpenAI Embeddings, or provider-specific embeddings compatible with Graphiti)
        *   Knowledge Graph Storage & Search (StockPulse_KnowledgeGraph - Graphiti/Neo4j)
        *   LLM Integration (for generation based on retrieved context, ideally supporting structured output for Graphiti)
    *   **Knowledge Sources:** Financial news APIs, market data providers, company filings, uploaded user documents (if applicable), application help guides.

### 5.2. AI Agent Architecture
    *   **Core Agent Framework:** (e.g., LangChain, Semantic Kernel)
    *   **Agent Types (Examples - to be expanded):**
        *   Market Insights Agent
        *   Portfolio Analysis Agent
        *   Trading Assistant Agent
        *   Onboarding & Support Agent
        *   Fraud Detection Agent
    *   **Communication:** See Section 6.

### 5.3. Model Management
    *   (TBD - How custom models or fine-tuned LLMs will be managed and deployed if used beyond API-based LLMs).

## 6. Networking & Communication

*   **Internal Communication:**
    *   REST APIs / gRPC for synchronous service-to-service calls.
    *   Message Queues (via StockPulse_Redis or a dedicated broker like RabbitMQ/Kafka if complexity grows) for asynchronous agent/service communication.
*   **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication:**
    *   Based on defined contracts/APIs.
    *   May leverage the message queue.
    *   Adherence to principles like Google's A2A protocol (clear roles, data formats).
*   **External Communication:**
    *   HTTPS for client-facing APIs.
    *   WebSockets for real-time client updates.
*   **API Gateway:** (e.g., Nginx, Kong, dedicated cloud provider gateway) for managing external API traffic.

## 7. Deployment & DevOps

*   **Source Control:** Git (GitHub, GitLab)
*   **CI/CD:** (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** (e.g., Terraform, Ansible) - Recommended.

## 8. Monitoring, Logging & Alerting

*   **Logging:** Centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK Stack, Grafana Loki).
*   **Monitoring:** (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for application and system metrics.
*   **Tracing:** (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) for distributed tracing across services/agents.
*   **Alerting:** (e.g., Alertmanager, PagerDuty integration).

## 9. Security Considerations

*   Authentication & Authorization (OAuth 2.0 / OIDC).
*   Data Encryption (at rest and in transit).
*   Network Security (Firewalls, Security Groups).
*   Input Validation & Sanitization.
*   Regular Security Audits.
*   Secrets Management (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).

## 10. Future Considerations

*   Multi-region deployment.
*   Advanced AI model training infrastructure.
*   Serverless functions for specific tasks.
