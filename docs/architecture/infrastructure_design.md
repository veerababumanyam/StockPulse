    participant MR as Market Researcher
    participant RM as Risk Manager

    U->>UA: "Analyze my portfolio and suggest improvements"
    UA->>PM: tasks/send (get current positions)
    PM->>UA: Portfolio data + risk metrics
    UA->>MR: tasks/send (get market outlook)
    MR->>UA: Market analysis + trends
    UA->>RM: tasks/send (assess portfolio risk)
    RM->>UA: Risk assessment + recommendations
    UA->>U: Consolidated portfolio recommendations
```

    participant U as User
    participant UA as User Assistant
    participant TA as Trading Assistant
    participant RM as Risk Manager
    participant PM as Portfolio Manager

    PM->>TA: Portfolio update confirmation
    TA->>UA: Trade execution status
    UA->>U: Trade confirmation
```

### 5.6. A2A Protocol Implementation

#### 5.6.1. Agent Card Structure

Each A2A agent publishes a standardized Agent Card following Google A2A specification:

```json
{
  "name": "StockPulse Portfolio Manager",
  "description": "AI agent for portfolio management and optimization",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "provider": {
    "organization": "StockPulse",
    "website": "https://stockpulse.ai"
  },
  "url": "https://localhost:9002",
  "documentationUrl": "https://docs.stockpulse.ai/agents/portfolio-manager",
  "capabilities": {
    "streaming": true,
    "pushNotifications": true,
    "stateTransitionHistory": true
  },
  "authentication": {
    "schemes": ["bearer", "oauth2"]
  },
  "defaultInputModes": ["text", "data"],
  "defaultOutputModes": ["text", "data"],
  "skills": [
    {
      "id": "portfolio-analysis",
      "name": "Portfolio Analysis",
      "description": "Comprehensive portfolio performance analysis",
      "tags": ["finance", "portfolio", "analysis"],
      "inputModes": ["text", "data"],
      "outputModes": ["text", "data"],
      "examples": [
        "Analyze my portfolio performance over the last quarter",
        "What are my best and worst performing holdings?"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 5.6.2. Task Lifecycle Management

A2A tasks follow the standard lifecycle:

- `submitted`: Task received but not yet started
- `working`: Task is actively being processed
- `input-required`: Agent needs more information
- `completed`: Task finished successfully
- `canceled`: Task terminated by request
- `failed`: An error occurred during processing

#### 5.6.3. Core A2A Methods

All A2A agents implement these JSON-RPC 2.0 methods:

- `tasks/send`: Initiate new task or provide additional input
- `tasks/get`: Retrieve task status and artifacts
- `tasks/cancel`: Cancel an ongoing task
- `tasks/sendSubscribe`: Initiate task with SSE streaming
- `tasks/pushNotification/set`: Configure push notifications

### 5.7. MCP Integration Strategy

A2A agents use MCP clients internally to access tools and data:

```python
# Example: Portfolio Manager Agent using MCP client
from mcp import Client

class PortfolioManagerAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mcp_postgres = Client("stockpulse-postgres")
        self.mcp_timescale = Client("stockpulse-timescale")
        self.mcp_redis = Client("stockpulse-redis")

    async def analyze_portfolio(self, user_id: str):
        # Use MCP to get portfolio data
        portfolios = await self.mcp_postgres.call_tool(
            "get_user_portfolios", {"user_id": user_id}
        )

        # Use MCP to get performance data
        performance = await self.mcp_timescale.call_tool(
            "get_portfolio_performance_timeseries",
            {"portfolio_id": portfolios[0]["id"]}
        )

        # Perform analysis and return A2A-formatted result
        return self.format_analysis_result(portfolios, performance)
```
