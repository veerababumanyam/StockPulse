## 1. Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive framework for designing, developing, fine-tuning, and operating AI agents within the StockPulse platform. Its purpose is to ensure consistency, robustness, effectiveness, and adherence to best practices, making our AI agents future-ready.

This document draws upon industry best practices and insights, including concepts from [Unlocking AI's Potential: A Simple Guide to RAG, Fine-Tuning, and Agents (Medium)](https://medium.com/the-abcs-of-ai/unlocking-ais-potential-a-simple-guide-to-rag-fine-tuning-and-agents-fa3d62cd4087) and principles from LLM fine-tuning literature such as [The Ultimate Guide to LLM Fine Tuning (Lakera.ai)](https://www.lakera.ai/blog/llm-fine-tuning-guide).

## 2. Foundational AI Strategies for StockPulse Agents

StockPulse agents will leverage a combination of fine-tuning, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and autonomous agent frameworks to maximize their capabilities.

### 2.1. Fine-Tuning LLMs
   - **Purpose:** Specializing base LLMs for specific financial domains, terminologies, and tasks.
   - **StockPulse Applications:** Financial sentiment analysis, regulatory document understanding, generating specific financial reports, specialized market analysis agents.
   - **Best Practices:**
      - Use of high-quality, task-specific financial datasets.
      - Start with strong pre-trained foundational models.
      - Adopt an iterative fine-tuning process with continuous evaluation.
      - Explore Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques (e.g., LoRA, QLoRA).
      - Define clear, measurable evaluation metrics for each fine-tuned model.
   - **Relevant Stories:** (Links to specific stories detailing fine-tuning needs will be added here)

### 2.2. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
   - **Purpose:** Empowering agents with real-time access to external and proprietary knowledge.
   - **StockPulse Applications:** Querying the AGI Knowledge Graph (Story 14.1), real-time news (Story 9.1), SEC Filings (Story 9.2), Analyst Reports (Story 9.3), Alternative Data (Story 9.4), and user-specific data (with security).
   - **Key Considerations:**
      - Optimal document chunking strategies for financial texts.
      - Selection of effective embedding models for financial domain.
      - Efficient vector database utilization (as per Story 14.1).
      - Potential for re-ranking retrieved results for enhanced relevance.
   - **Relevant Stories:** Story 14.1, Story 9.1, Story 9.2, Story 9.3, Story 9.4

### 2.3. Autonomous Agent Framework
   - **Purpose:** Enabling LLMs to plan, decompose tasks, and execute actions using integrated tools.
   - **StockPulse Applications:** Core of all AGI functionalities – data analysis, (mock) trade execution, report generation, notification management, user interaction.
   - **Hybrid Approach:** StockPulse agents will typically be fine-tuned for their domain, use RAG for up-to-date information, and operate within an agentic framework to perform actions.

## 3. Core LLM Parameter Tuning for Agents

LLM generation behavior is controlled by several key parameters. These should be configurable per agent type or task via the System Configuration (Story 10.6).

### 3.1. Sampling Temperature
   - **Range:** 0.0 (deterministic) to 2.0 (highly random - typically use up to 1.0-1.2).
   - **Guidance:** Lower for factual/analytical tasks (e.g., 0.2-0.5), higher for creative/conversational tasks (e.g., 0.7-1.0). Default start: 0.7.

### 3.2. TopP (Nucleus Sampling)
   - **Range:** 0.0 to 1.0.
   - **Guidance:** Often used with temperature. Lower for factual tasks (e.g., 0.5-0.7), higher for diverse outputs (e.g., 0.9-0.95). Default start: 0.9.

### 3.3. Frequency Penalty
   - **Range:** Typically 0.0 to 2.0.
   - **Guidance:** Small positive values (e.g., 0.1-0.5) to reduce verbatim repetition in longer outputs.

### 3.4. Presence Penalty
   - **Range:** Typically 0.0 to 2.0.
   - **Guidance:** Small positive values (e.g., 0.1-0.5) to encourage discussion of new topics, if distinct from frequency penalty.

## 4. Operational Best Practices for Agent Interactions

### 4.1. Timeouts
   - **Purpose:** Prevent indefinite hanging on LLM calls or tool executions.
   - **Implementation:** Configurable timeouts (default 30-60s for LLM, variable for tools).

### 4.2. Max Retries
   - **Purpose:** Handle transient errors.
   - **Implementation:** Exponential backoff strategy with configurable max retries (e.g., 3-5 attempts). Differentiate retryable vs. non-retryable errors.

### 4.3. Max Iterations (Agent Loops)
   - **Purpose:** Prevent infinite loops in agent planning/execution cycles.
   - **Implementation:** Configurable maximum number of iterations for an agent's internal thought-action-observation loop.

### 4.4. Return Intermediate Steps
   - **Purpose:** Debugging, explainability (XAI - Story 13.6), user understanding.
   - **Implementation:** Agents should log or optionally return their thought process, tool calls, and intermediate observations. Configurable verbosity.

## 5. Essential Agent Capabilities & Features

### 5.1. Handling Binary Data & Images
   - **Input:** Use multi-modal models or dedicated vision tools to provide textual descriptions of images/charts to LLMs.
   - **Output/Passthrough:** Agent framework to manage binary data generated or received, providing references/links in textual output.

### 5.2. Output Parsers
   - **Purpose:** Convert LLM text output into structured formats (e.g., JSON).
   - **Implementation:** Robust parsers per task. Techniques: structured prompting, regex, LLM framework parsers. Include error handling for parsing failures.

## 6. Memory Systems for StockPulse Agents

### 6.1. Long-Term Memory (LTM)
   - **Primary Semantic Memory:** AGI Knowledge Graph (Epic 14, Story 14.1).
      - Interaction: RAG queries, tool-based KG update proposals (validated per Story 9.5).
   - **Episodic Memory:** Agent's past experiences and interactions (Story 14.4).
   - **Procedural Memory:** Learned skills and procedures (Story 14.5).

### 6.2. Short-Term Memory (STM)
   - **Conversational Memory (Chat History):** PostgreSQL-based storage for user-agent conversations. Implement context window management (summarization/truncation).
   - **Working Memory (Task Context):** Dynamic buffer for current task-relevant information – intermediate thoughts, tool outputs, etc. (Story 14.6).

## 7. Tool Integration & MCP Framework

### 7.1. Agent-Specific Tools
   - **Principle:** Curated set of tools per agent, relevant to its purpose.
   - **Design:** Well-defined tools with clear input/output schemas, robust error handling, and versioning.
   - **Examples:** Market data fetchers, KG queriers, news retrieval tools, calculation utilities, (mock) trading execution tools.

### 7.2. MCP (Model-Controller-Persona/Prompt) Framework
   - **Model:** Base LLM, potentially fine-tuned for the agent's domain.
   - **Controller:** Core agent logic – manages lifecycle, input processing, memory, tool orchestration, LLM interaction, output processing.
   - **Persona/Prompt:** System prompts defining the agent's role, capabilities, constraints, tone, and task-specific instructions. Critical for guiding behavior.
   - **Flexibility:** Framework must support diverse agent types and complexities.

## 8. Agent Observability & Monitoring

   - **Logging:** Comprehensive logging of agent actions, decisions, tool calls, errors (linking to Story 10.3, 10.5).
   - **Metrics:** Track performance (latency, throughput), accuracy, task completion rates, resource usage.
   - **Alerting:** Set up alerts for critical agent failures, performance degradation, or anomalous behavior (Story 10.4).
   - **Explainability:** Ensure intermediate steps can be surfaced for XAI (Story 13.6).

## 9. Security & Ethical Considerations for Agents

   - **Data Handling:** Secure processing of sensitive data (user PII, financial data) by agents.
   - **Tool Usage:** Secure and constrained tool execution. Agents should not have overly broad permissions.
   - **Bias Mitigation:** Awareness and mitigation of potential biases in LLM responses or agent decisions (Story 13.2).
   - **Safety & Control:** Adherence to AGI safety and control mechanisms (Story 13.4).
   - **Ethical Guidelines:** Agent behavior must align with StockPulse ethical principles (Story 13.1, 13.7).

## 10. Governance & Lifecycle Management

   - **Versioning:** Version control for agent prompts, configurations, and associated tools.
   - **Testing:** Rigorous testing strategies for agents, including unit tests for tools, integration tests for agent logic, and end-to-end evaluation of agent performance on specific tasks.
   - **Deployment:** Controlled deployment strategies for new or updated agents (e.g., canary releases, A/B testing via feature flags - Story 10.6).
   - **Maintenance:** Ongoing monitoring and re-evaluation of agent performance, with processes for updates, re-tuning, or decommissioning.
