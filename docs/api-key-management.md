# API Key Management System Design

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive design for the API Key Management System in StockPulse, providing secure storage, management, and usage of API keys for various services including financial data providers and LLM APIs.

## Architecture

### System Components

1. **Frontend Management Interface**
   - User-friendly key management UI
   - Secure input and display mechanisms
   - Role-based access controls
   - Audit logging for key operations

2. **Backend Proxy Service**
   - Secure key storage
   - Request proxying to protect keys
   - Rate limiting and quota management
   - Usage tracking and analytics

3. **Encryption Layer**
   - At-rest encryption for stored keys
   - In-transit encryption for key transmission
   - Key rotation mechanisms
   - Secure key generation (when applicable)

4. **Access Control System**
   - Role-based permissions for key management
   - Granular access to specific key categories
   - Approval workflows for sensitive operations
   - Audit trail for all key-related actions

## User Interface Design

### API Key Dashboard

The main API key management dashboard provides:

1. **Key Overview Panel**
   - List of all configured API services
   - Status indicators (active, expired, quota limited)
   - Last used timestamp
   - Usage metrics and quota information

2. **Category Organization**
   - Keys grouped by service type (Financial Data, LLM Providers, etc.)
   - Visual indicators for key status
   - Quick actions for common operations
   - Search and filter capabilities

3. **Security Indicators**
   - Key strength assessment
   - Rotation recommendations
   - Usage anomaly warnings
   - Compliance status indicators

### Key Management Interface

For each API key, users can:

1. **Add New Keys**
   - Service selection with guided setup
   - Secure input field with visibility toggle
   - Automatic validation where possible
   - Optional alias/description field

2. **Edit Existing Keys**
   - Update key value securely
   - Modify description and metadata
   - Adjust usage limits and permissions
   - Enable/disable key without deletion

3. **Key Rotation**
   - Scheduled rotation reminders
   - Guided rotation process
   - Temporary dual-key support during transition
   - Verification of new key functionality

4. **Deletion and Revocation**
   - Soft deletion with recovery period
   - Emergency revocation option
   - Impact assessment before deletion
   - Confirmation workflow for critical keys

### Usage Analytics

The analytics view provides:

1. **Usage Metrics**
   - Requests per day/week/month
   - Cost tracking (for paid APIs)
   - Success/failure rates
   - Quota utilization trends

2. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Unusual usage pattern alerts
   - Potential security breach indicators
   - Cost spike warnings
   - Service disruption detection

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Components

1. **Secure Input Handling**
   - Masked input fields by default
   - Clipboard integration with security controls
   - Temporary visibility toggle
   - Auto-clearing of displayed keys

2. **Status Monitoring**
   - Real-time status indicators
   - Automated validation checks
   - Expiration monitoring
   - Usage quota tracking

3. **User Guidance**
   - Contextual help for each service
   - Setup wizards for complex integrations
   - Troubleshooting guides
   - Best practice recommendations

### Backend Services

1. **Secure Storage**
   - Encrypted database fields
   - Hardware security module integration (optional)
   - Separation from other application data
   - Regular backup with enhanced security

2. **Proxy Mechanism**
   - Request interception and enrichment
   - Key injection at request time
   - Response caching where appropriate
   - Error handling and retry logic

3. **Monitoring Service**
   - Usage tracking and analytics
   - Anomaly detection
   - Quota management
   - Health checks for connected services

## Security Considerations

1. **Key Protection**
   - Never expose keys in client-side code
   - Encrypt keys at rest using strong encryption
   - Implement key rotation policies
   - Use environment-specific keys

2. **Access Controls**
   - Strict role-based access to key management
   - Multi-factor authentication for key operations
   - IP restrictions for key management access
   - Audit logging for all key-related actions

3. **Breach Prevention and Response**
   - Automated monitoring for suspicious activity
   - Instant revocation capabilities
   - Incident response procedures
   - Regular security audits

## Best Practices

1. **Key Management Lifecycle**
   - Implement regular key rotation schedules
   - Document purpose and ownership of each key
   - Establish emergency revocation procedures
   - Create key backup and recovery processes

2. **User Education**
   - Provide clear security guidelines
   - Train users on secure key handling
   - Document potential security risks
   - Establish clear responsibility chains

3. **System Integration**
   - Use standardized API for key retrieval
   - Implement graceful failure modes
   - Provide fallback mechanisms
   - Ensure proper error handling

4. **Compliance and Governance**
   - Maintain compliance with relevant regulations
   - Implement appropriate retention policies
   - Conduct regular security reviews
   - Document all security measures
