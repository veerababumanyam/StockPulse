# API Key Management System Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for a secure, user-friendly API key management system for StockPulse. The system will allow users to manage API keys for various services, including financial data providers and LLM providers, while maintaining security best practices.

## Security Considerations

1. **No Frontend Storage of Actual Keys**
   - API keys will never be stored in the frontend
   - Keys will be stored securely on the backend using encryption
   - Frontend will only display masked versions of keys (e.g., `sk-***********ABCD`)

2. **Backend Proxy Architecture**
   - All API calls requiring keys will be proxied through the backend
   - Frontend will make requests to backend endpoints that handle actual API calls
   - Backend will inject the appropriate keys before forwarding requests

3. **Key Rotation and Revocation**
   - Support for key rotation with minimal disruption
   - Ability to immediately revoke compromised keys
   - Historical usage tracking for auditing purposes

## User Interface Design

### API Keys Management Page

The API Keys Management page will provide a centralized interface for users to manage all their API keys.

#### Layout

1. **Header Section**
   - Title: "API Key Management"
   - Description: Brief explanation of how API keys are used and secured
   - Security notice: Reminder about key security best practices

2. **Provider Categories**
   - Tabs or sections for different categories of API providers:
     - Financial Data Providers
     - LLM Providers
     - Trading APIs
     - Other Services

3. **Provider List**
   - For each category, display a list of supported providers
   - Status indicator showing if keys are configured
   - Last used/verified timestamp

4. **Key Management Interface**
   - Add/Edit/Delete operations for each provider
   - Masked display of existing keys
   - Connection test functionality
   - Usage statistics and quotas

### Add/Edit Key Modal

When adding or editing an API key, a modal will appear with the following elements:

1. **Provider Information**
   - Provider name and logo
   - Link to provider's API documentation
   - Required and optional fields specific to the provider

2. **Key Input Fields**
   - API Key / Secret Key input (password field)
   - Organization ID (if applicable)
   - Additional provider-specific fields
   - Environment selection (Production/Development)

3. **Validation and Testing**
   - "Test Connection" button to verify key validity
   - Real-time validation of key format
   - Clear error messages for invalid keys

4. **Save and Cancel Actions**
   - Save button (disabled until all required fields are valid)
   - Cancel button
   - "Save and Add Another" option for batch configuration

## Backend Architecture

### API Key Storage

1. **Encrypted Storage**
   - Keys stored in encrypted format in the database
   - Encryption/decryption handled by backend services
   - Key-value store with provider identifiers as keys

2. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access to key management
   - Admin-only operations for certain providers
   - Audit logging for all key operations

### Proxy Service

1. **Request Forwarding**
   - Backend endpoints that mirror external API endpoints
   - Key injection before forwarding requests
   - Response normalization for consistent frontend handling

2. **Rate Limiting and Quotas**
   - Tracking of API usage per provider
   - Enforcement of rate limits to prevent quota exhaustion
   - Alerts for approaching quota limits

3. **Caching Layer**
   - Caching of appropriate responses to reduce API calls
   - Cache invalidation strategies
   - Bypass options for real-time data requirements

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Create secure key storage service
2. Implement backend proxy architecture
3. Develop basic UI for key management

### Phase 2: Provider Integration

1. Integrate Financial Data Providers (Financial Modeling Prep, TAAPI.IO, etc.)
2. Integrate LLM Providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
3. Add provider-specific validation and testing

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. Implement usage analytics and quota management
2. Add key rotation and scheduled refreshes
3. Develop comprehensive audit logging

## Security Audit Checklist
