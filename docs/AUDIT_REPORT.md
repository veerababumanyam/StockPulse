**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Audit Type:** Security and Dependency Review

## 1. Executive Summary

This report documents the findings from the security and dependency audit conducted on the StockPulse application. The audit covered:

- JavaScript/TypeScript dependency vulnerabilities
- Python dependency vulnerabilities
- Code quality analysis
- Security best practices

## 2. JavaScript/TypeScript Dependencies

### 2.1. Outdated Packages

The following npm packages were found to be outdated:

- **zod**: 
  - Current: 3.25.30
  - Wanted: 3.25.46

- **Error**: Dependency `@emnapi/core@^1.4.3` was not found in package-lock.json
- **Root Cause**: Package.json and package-lock.json are out of sync
- **Recommendation**: Run `npm install` to synchronize dependencies

## 3. Python Dependencies

### 3.1. pip-audit

The `pip-audit` tool was not found in the system. To install it, run:
```bash
pip install pip-audit
```

## 4. Code Quality Analysis

### 4.1. ESLint Results
- **Status**: ✅ No issues found
- **Command**: `npx eslint .`

### 4.2. Bandit Security Scanner
- **Status**: ⚠️ Not run (Python environment not configured)
- **Recommendation**: Install bandit and run security scan

## 5. Security Findings

### 5.1. High Priority
1. **Outdated Dependencies**
   - Package: zod
   - Current Version: 3.25.30
   - Latest Version: 3.25.46
   - Risk: Potential security vulnerabilities in outdated versions

2. **Dependency Sync Issue**
   - Mismatch between package.json and package-lock.json
   - Risk: Could lead to inconsistent builds and security vulnerabilities

## 6. Recommendations

### 6.1. Immediate Actions
1. Update outdated packages:
   ```bash
   npm update zod
   ```

2. Synchronize package files:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up Python security scanning:
   ```bash
   pip install pip-audit bandit
   pip-audit
   bandit -r src/ tests/
   ```

### 6.2. Long-term Improvements
1. **Dependency Management**
   - Implement Dependabot for automated dependency updates
   - Configure Renovate for automated security patches

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Add security scanning to CI/CD pipeline
   - Implement automated testing for security vulnerabilities

3. **Documentation**
   - Document the update process for dependencies
   - Create a security policy document

## 7. Next Steps

1. [ ] Update zod to the latest version
2. [ ] Synchronize package.json and package-lock.json
3. [ ] Set up Python security tooling
4. [ ] Schedule regular security audits
5. [ ] Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD
