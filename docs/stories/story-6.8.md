# Story 6.8: Implement Data Quality Assurance Framework (Initial Rules & Alerts)

**As a** system (and for the Data Engineering Team and AI Agents relying on clean data),
**I need** an initial Data Quality Assurance (DQA) framework with basic rules and alerts for data ingested through our pipelines,
**So that** the reliability and accuracy of our foundational data can be actively monitored, and potential data issues can be identified and addressed promptly.

## Description
This story focuses on establishing the first layer of data quality checks for the ingested market, fundamental, and news data. It involves defining and implementing basic validation rules, checks for anomalies, and setting up alerts for when data quality issues are detected.

Key features include:
-   Define an initial set of data quality rules for key data types (e.g., equities, fundamentals):
    *   **Completeness checks:** (e.g., are all expected fields present? Are there gaps in time-series data?).
    *   **Validity checks:** (e.g., are prices within expected ranges? Are dates valid? Are sentiment scores within the defined scale?).
    *   **Consistency checks:** (e.g., does OHLC data make sense: O <= H, L <= O, L <= C, C <= H? Does volume look reasonable compared to historical averages?).
    *   **Uniqueness checks:** (e.g., for primary keys or unique identifiers).
-   Implement these rules as part of the data ingestion pipelines (Story 6.7) or as separate post-ingestion validation processes.
-   Develop mechanisms to flag or quarantine data that fails quality checks.
-   Set up alerts (e.g., to Data Engineering team via email, Slack) when significant data quality issues or a high volume of failures are detected.
-   Create basic DQA reports or dashboard views summarizing data quality metrics (e.g., percentage of valid records, number of anomalies detected).
-   Document the initial DQA rules and procedures.
-   **AI Integration (Basic):** Potentially use simple statistical methods or rule-based AI to identify outliers or anomalies in data streams (e.g., price spikes, unusual volume).

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: DQA Rules Defined & Implemented:** An initial set of documented data quality rules (completeness, validity, consistency, uniqueness) is defined and implemented for key data types.
2.  **AC2: Automated Checks:** Data quality checks are automated and run as part of the ingestion process or shortly thereafter.
3.  **AC3: Issue Flagging/Quarantining:** Data failing quality checks is appropriately flagged, and a mechanism exists to quarantine or isolate suspect data if necessary.
4.  **AC4: Alerting Mechanism:** Alerts are triggered and sent to the relevant team(s) when predefined DQA thresholds are breached (e.g., high error rate, critical data missing).
5.  **AC5: Basic DQA Reporting:** Basic reports or dashboard widgets are available, showing key data quality metrics and trends.
6.  **AC6: Documentation:** The initial DQA rules, alerting conditions, and remediation steps (if any) are documented.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   The initial Data Quality Assurance framework is operational.
-   Automated checks are running, and alerts are functional.
-   Basic DQA reporting is available.
-   Code for DQA checks and framework reviewed, merged, and tested.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) and Data Engineering Lead confirm the DQA framework provides useful insights into data integrity.

## AI Integration Details

-   **Foundation for Advanced AI in DQA:** This story lays the groundwork. More sophisticated AI/ML models for anomaly detection, data imputation, and predictive data quality can be built upon this in future epics/stories.
-   AI agents consuming platform data will heavily benefit from improved data quality ensured by this framework.
-   Simple AI techniques (e.g., statistical outlier detection) might be used for some of the initial DQA rules.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   DQA reports/dashboards will have a UI for internal teams (Data Engineering, Ops).

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 6: Data Sources & Market Integration](../epic-6.md)
-   Completed data ingestion pipelines (Story 6.7) as DQA checks will often integrate with these.
-   Monitoring and alerting infrastructure (from Story 6.7 or separate).
-   Access to ingested data in `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`, `StockPulse_PostgreSQL`, etc.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Defining the right balance for initial DQA rules: comprehensive enough to be useful but not so strict as to generate excessive false positives.
-   Choosing tools or libraries for implementing DQA checks (e.g., Great Expectations, Deequ, custom scripts).
-   Determining appropriate thresholds for alerting.
-   Complexity of implementing checks across diverse data types and sources.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Accuracy of Checks:** DQA rules should accurately identify genuine data quality issues.
-   **Performance:** DQA checks should not significantly slow down data ingestion pipelines.
-   **Scalability:** The DQA framework should scale with increasing data volumes.
-   **Maintainability:** DQA rules and logic should be easy to update and manage.
