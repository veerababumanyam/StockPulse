# Story 8.1: Implement Advanced Charting Module with AI-Suggested Indicators & Pattern Recognition

**As a** user (trader or analyst),
**I want** an advanced charting module with a comprehensive library of technical indicators, drawing tools, and AI-powered assistance for suggesting relevant indicators and identifying common chart patterns,
**So that** I can perform in-depth technical analysis and make more informed trading decisions.

## Description
This story focuses on delivering a best-in-class charting experience, augmented with AI capabilities to assist in technical analysis. It enhances the basic charting from Story 4.3.

Key features include:
-   Integration of a feature-rich charting library (e.g., TradingView Lightweight Charts or a comparable alternative).
-   Support for multiple chart types (candlestick, bar, line, area, Heikin Ashi, Renko, etc.).
-   Extensive library of common technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Retracements, Ichimoku Cloud, Stochastics, ADX, OBV) with customizable parameters.
-   Comprehensive drawing tools (trend lines, channels, support/resistance lines, Fibonacci tools, Gann fans, geometric shapes, text annotations).
-   Ability to save chart layouts, templates, and indicator sets.
-   **AI Integration - Indicator Suggestion:** An "AI Technical Pattern Recognition Agent" suggests potentially relevant technical indicators based on current market volatility, trend strength, or instrument type.
-   **AI Integration - Pattern Recognition:** The same AI agent can highlight common candlestick patterns (e.g., doji, hammer, engulfing) and basic chart patterns (e.g., head and shoulders, double top/bottom, triangles, flags) directly on the chart, with explanations.
-   Real-time data updates on charts.
-   Multiple timeframes (intraday, daily, weekly, monthly).

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Charting Library Integrated:** An advanced charting library is successfully integrated and functional.
2.  **AC2: Comprehensive Indicators & Drawing Tools:** A wide range of specified technical indicators and drawing tools are available and configurable.
3.  **AC3: Chart Customization & Saving:** Users can customize chart appearance, apply multiple indicators, use drawing tools, and save/load their chart layouts and indicator templates.
4.  **AC4: AI Indicator Suggestions:** The AI agent provides contextually relevant suggestions for technical indicators on the current chart/instrument (e.g., via a small, non-intrusive UI element).
5.  **AC5: AI Pattern Recognition:** The AI agent identifies and visually highlights at least 3-5 common candlestick patterns and 2-3 basic chart patterns on the chart, with brief tooltips explaining the pattern.
6.  **AC6: Real-time & Multi-Timeframe:** Charts update in real-time (or near real-time) and support various timeframes from intraday to monthly.
7.  **AC7: Performance:** Charts are responsive and performant, even with multiple indicators and data points.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   The advanced charting module is implemented with all specified features, including AI suggestions and pattern recognition.
-   Charts are performant, accurate, and customizable.
-   AI features are providing useful, non-intrusive assistance.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and unit/integration tests passed.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) and a sample technical analyst user have validated the charting capabilities and AI features.

## AI Integration Details

-   **AI Technical Pattern Recognition Agent:**
    *   Analyzes price/volume data to identify candlestick and chart patterns.
    *   Analyzes market conditions (volatility, trend) to suggest relevant indicators.
    *   This agent will likely use a combination of rule-based systems (for well-defined patterns) and machine learning models (for more nuanced suggestions or complex patterns).
    *   Requires access to historical and real-time market data via the Data Access API Layer (Story 6.9).
-   Feedback on the usefulness of AI suggestions/patterns can be collected via Story 7.4 mechanisms.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   The charting interface should be intuitive and powerful, catering to both novice and experienced traders.
-   AI suggestions should be presented as helpful hints, not prescriptive advice, allowing users to easily accept or ignore them.
-   Visual highlighting of patterns should be clear but not clutter the chart.
-   Easy access to indicator settings and drawing tool palettes.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 8: Advanced Analytics & Insights](../epic-8.md)
-   Story 4.3 (Integrate Interactive Price Charts) - this story significantly expands upon it.
-   Story 6.1 & 6.2 (Real-time & Historical Equity Data) for chart data feeds via Story 6.9.
-   Story 7.7 (AI Meta-Agent/Orchestrator Backend) to manage the AI Technical Pattern Recognition Agent.
-   A chosen charting library.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Selection of the charting library: balancing features, performance, licensing costs, and ease of integration.
-   Complexity of developing or integrating reliable AI for pattern recognition and indicator suggestion.
-   Ensuring AI suggestions are genuinely helpful and not just noise.
-   Performance of AI analysis on real-time chart data.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Performance:** Charts must load quickly and update smoothly, even with many data points and indicators.
-   **Accuracy:** Chart data and indicator calculations must be precise.
-   **Usability:** Interface must be intuitive for complex technical analysis tasks.
-   **Reliability:** Charting module must be stable.
