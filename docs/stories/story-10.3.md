# Story 10.3: Centralized Logging & Monitoring Dashboard for Platform Administrators

**Epic:** Epic 10: Platform Administration & Observability
**Story ID:** 10.3
**Story Title:** Centralized Logging & Monitoring Dashboard for Platform Administrators
**Assigned to:** Backend Team, Frontend Team, DevOps Team
**Story Points:** 10

## Business Context
As a StockPulse platform administrator, I need a centralized dashboard to view system logs, monitor application health, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and investigate incidents efficiently. This unified view is crucial for proactive system management, rapid troubleshooting, and maintaining overall platform stability and performance.

## User Story
**As a** platform administrator
**I want to** access a centralized logging and monitoring dashboard
**So that** I can effectively oversee system health, diagnose issues quickly, track performance metrics, and ensure the smooth operation of the StockPulse platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Unified Log Aggregation & Search
- Ingestion of logs from all critical platform components (backend services, databases, AGI components, infrastructure) into a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk).
- Real-time log streaming and powerful search capabilities (full-text search, filtering by source, severity, timestamp, keywords).
- Structured logging format (e.g., JSON) for easy parsing and analysis.
- Log retention policies configurable by administrators.
- Ability to save common search queries and create custom log views.
- Correlation of logs across different services for distributed tracing of requests.

### 2. Real-Time System Health Monitoring
- Dashboard widgets displaying real-time health status of key platform services and infrastructure components (e.g., CPU, memory, disk, network usage).
- Visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as request latency, error rates, and throughput for critical APIs and services.
- Customizable alert thresholds for various metrics, triggering notifications to administrators (linking to Story 10.4 - Advanced Alerting).
- Synthetic monitoring of critical user flows and API endpoints to proactively detect issues.
- Display of active incidents and ongoing maintenance activities.
- Service dependency mapping visualization to understand potential impact of component failures.

### 3. Application Performance Monitoring (APM) Integration
- Integration with APM tools (e.g., DataDog, New Relic, Dynatrace, or open-source alternatives like Jaeger/Zipkin for tracing) to provide deep insights into application performance.
- Visualization of transaction traces, identifying bottlenecks in distributed services.
- Database query performance monitoring.
- Code-level performance profiling for identifying slow functions or methods.
- Monitoring of AGI model serving performance (latency, throughput - linking to Story 8.6).
- User-centric performance metrics (e.g., page load times, API response times experienced by users).

### 4. Customizable Dashboards & Reporting
- Ability for administrators to create and customize their own dashboards by selecting and arranging relevant widgets.
- Role-based access to different dashboards or data views (e.g., a database admin sees more DB-specific metrics).
- Generation of periodic performance and health reports (e.g., daily, weekly summaries).
- Export functionality for logs, metrics, and report data (e.g., CSV, PDF).
- Templating for common dashboard layouts (e.g., "Backend Services Health," "AGI Performance").
- Version control or history for dashboard configurations.

### 5. Incident Management & Root Cause Analysis Support
- Quick access to relevant logs and metrics when an alert is triggered or an incident is reported.
- Tools for annotating logs or metrics during an investigation.
- Integration with incident management systems (e.g., PagerDuty, Opsgenie) for alert escalation and incident tracking.
- Historical data analysis to identify trends or patterns leading up to an incident.
- "Time-travel" debugging or replaying event sequences from logs where feasible.
- Direct links from alerts to pre-filtered views in the logging/monitoring dashboard.

### 6. Security & Access Control for Monitoring Data
- Secure access to the logging and monitoring dashboard, with authentication and authorization.
- Role-based permissions to control who can view specific logs, metrics, or dashboards (sensitive data might be masked or restricted).
- Audit trails for access and significant actions taken within the monitoring dashboard itself.
- Protection against unauthorized modification of monitoring configurations or alert settings.
- Compliance with data privacy regulations for any user data visible in logs or traces.
- Regular security reviews of the monitoring infrastructure.

## Technical Guidance

### Backend Implementation (Python/FastAPI) - (APIs for custom dashboard data, or integrations)
```python
# API Endpoints (for feeding custom dashboards or managing configs)
GET /api/v1/admin/monitoring/dashboard_data/{dashboard_name}
GET /api/v1/admin/monitoring/logs/query
GET /api/v1/admin/monitoring/metrics/query
POST /api/v1/admin/monitoring/dashboard/save_config
GET /api/v1/admin/monitoring/service_health_status

# Key Functions
async def query_centralized_log_store(log_query_params)
async def fetch_metrics_from_prometheus_or_equivalent(metric_query_params)
async def get_aggregated_service_health()
async def manage_dashboard_configurations_for_users()
async def integrate_with_apm_tool_api(apm_query)
```

### Frontend Implementation (TypeScript/React) - (The Monitoring Dashboard UI)
```typescript
interface MonitoringDashboard {
  id: string;
  dashboardName: string;
  widgets: DashboardWidget[];
  timeRangeSelector: {_from: string; _to: string; relative?: string };
  autoRefreshInterval?: number;
}

interface DashboardWidget {
  widgetId: string;
  widgetType: 'log_view' | 'timeseries_chart' | 'health_status_panel' | 'alert_list';
  title: string;
  configuration: any; // Specific to widget type (e.g., log query, metric query)
  gridPosition: { x: number; y: number; w: number; h: number };
}

interface LogEntry {
  timestamp: Date;
  serviceName: string;
  severity: 'INFO' | 'WARN' | 'ERROR' | 'DEBUG';
  message: string;
  traceId?: string;
  spanId?: string;
  [key: string]: any; // For structured log fields
}
```

### AI Integration Components
- AI-powered log anomaly detection to proactively identify unusual patterns.
- NLP for intelligent log summarization or clustering.
- AI-driven predictive analytics for forecasting potential system failures based on metric trends.
- Automated root cause analysis suggestions based on correlated logs and metrics.
- Natural language querying of logs and metrics (future enhancement).
- **Agent Design:** Adhere to principles in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` for AI components performing log analysis, anomaly detection, or predictive analytics.

### Database Schema Updates (Primarily managed by dedicated logging/monitoring systems)
```sql
-- Log data is typically stored in specialized systems like Elasticsearch or Loki.
-- Metric data in systems like Prometheus or InfluxDB.
-- This schema might be for dashboard configurations or user preferences.

CREATE TABLE admin_dashboard_configurations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    admin_user_id UUID REFERENCES platform_administrators(id),
    dashboard_name VARCHAR(255),
    layout_config JSONB, -- Stores widget types, positions, and their individual configs
    is_default BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE (admin_user_id, dashboard_name)
);

CREATE TABLE saved_log_queries (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    admin_user_id UUID REFERENCES platform_administrators(id),
    query_name VARCHAR(255),
    log_source_target VARCHAR(100), -- e.g., 'Elasticsearch', 'Loki'
    query_details JSONB, -- The actual query string or parameters
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
