# Story 7.3: Create Agent-Specific Settings and Preferences

**As a** user,
**I want** to access and modify settings specific to each AI agent (e.g., enable/disable agent, adjust sensitivity for some alerts, define communication preferences, customize analysis depth, set risk tolerance for recommendations),
**So that** I can tailor how each AI agent operates to better suit my individual needs, preferences, and investment style, thereby increasing my control and trust in the AI.

## Business Context:
This story enables user personalization of AI agent behaviors without compromising their core value. By allowing users to fine-tune agent settings, we increase user satisfaction and engagement while maintaining the integrity of AI-driven insights. It empowers users to align AI assistance more closely with their personal financial strategies and comfort levels.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1.  **AC1: Agent Settings Access & Navigation:**
    *   A dedicated settings area is accessible for each configurable AI agent, reachable from the AI Agent Hub (Story 7.1) and potentially from individual agent detail views.
    *   Settings are logically categorized for clarity (e.g., General, Notifications, Analysis & Recommendations, Data Sources, Performance Tuning).
    *   Users can easily save and apply settings, receiving immediate feedback on success or failure.
    *   A "Reset to default settings" option is available for each agent or category.
    *   The UI clearly explains what each setting affects, possibly with tooltips or brief descriptions.
    *   A mechanism to preview the potential impact of changes before applying might be considered for complex settings (optional, based on complexity).
2.  **AC2: General Agent Settings:**
    *   Users can enable or disable individual AI agents (non-critical agents only; critical agents like Fraud Detection might be non-disableable or have restricted controls).
    *   Ability to temporarily disable all non-critical agent functions globally might be provided.
3.  **AC3: Notification Preferences (Agent-Specific & Global Overrides):**
    *   Users can control notification frequency from agents (e.g., Real-time, Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Never).
    *   Users can choose notification delivery methods for agent alerts/insights (e.g., In-app, Email, Push â€“ integrating with a platform-wide notification system if available).
    *   Users can set thresholds for specific alert types (e.g., "Only notify for portfolio value changes > 5%").
    *   Users can configure custom quiet hours and days during which non-critical notifications are suppressed.
4.  **AC4: Analysis and Recommendation Settings (Examples, Agent-Dependent):**
    *   **Trade Advisor/Portfolio Optimizer:** Adjust risk tolerance for recommendations (e.g., Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive). Enable/disable specific types of trading strategy suggestions (e.g., turn off options trading suggestions if not interested).
    *   **Market Insights Agent:** Adjust analysis depth (e.g., Quick Overview, Standard, Comprehensive). Customize insight complexity level (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
5.  **AC5: Data Source Preferences (Examples, Agent-Dependent):**
    *   **Market Insights Agent:** Choose preferred news sources or sectors for market analysis. Set geographic focus for market analysis (e.g., US-only, Global, specific regions).
    *   Enable/disable specific data types to be considered in analysis by certain agents (e.g., include/exclude technical analysis, fundamental analysis, or sentiment analysis inputs for insights generation).
6.  **AC6: Performance and Behavior Tuning (Examples, Agent-Dependent):**
    *   Set preference for response speed vs. accuracy for certain query-based agents (e.g., Faster with potentially cached/slightly older data vs. More Accurate with real-time processing that might take longer).
    *   Adjust sensitivity to market changes for alert-generating agents.
    *   Configure update frequencies for specific agent background functions (where applicable and user-configurable).
7.  **AC7: Settings Persistence & Application:**
    *   User-configured settings for AI agents are securely saved and persist across sessions.
    *   Configured AI agents correctly retrieve and apply these user-defined settings, demonstrably affecting their behavior, output, or alert generation as intended.
    *   Settings changes propagate to active agents in a timely manner (e.g., within 30 seconds or on next operational cycle).
8.  **AC8: UI & Validation:**
    *   Settings interface is intuitive, responsive, and accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA).
    *   Client-side and server-side validation is in place for all setting inputs to prevent invalid configurations.

## Technical Guidance:

### Frontend Implementation:
-   **Framework:** React/TypeScript.
-   **UI Components:** Develop settings panels with clearly grouped controls (toggles, sliders, dropdowns, text inputs), adhering to the StockPulse design system. Implement form validation and consider real-time previews for certain settings if feasible.
-   **State Management:** Utilize React Context or a dedicated state management library for managing settings state, with optimistic updates for a smoother UX where appropriate.
-   **Validation:** Implement thorough client-side validation with clear error messages, complemented by robust server-side confirmation.

### API Endpoints (to be provided by AI Meta-Agent or a dedicated Settings Service - Story 7.7 context):
-   `GET /api/ai-agents/{agentId}/settings`: Retrieve current agent-specific settings for the authenticated user.
-   `PUT /api/ai-agents/{agentId}/settings`: Update (and persist) agent-specific settings for the user.
-   `POST /api/ai-agents/{agentId}/settings/reset`: Reset settings for a specific agent to their default values for the user.
-   `GET /api/ai-agents/settings/schema` (Optional): Retrieve an agent settings schema, potentially per agent type, for dynamic form generation or validation rules if settings are highly dynamic.

### Settings Data Model (Illustrative - to be finalized with backend, versioned):
```typescript
interface AgentSettings {
  agentId: string;
  userId: string;
  version: number; // For optimistic locking and history
  lastUpdated: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp
  general: {
    isEnabled: boolean;
  };
  notifications?: {
    frequency: 'realtime' | 'hourly' | 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'never';
    methods: ('in-app' | 'email' | 'push')[];
    thresholds?: Record<string, number>; // e.g., { portfolioChangePercent: 5 }
    quietHours?: { start: string; end: string; days: string[] }; // e.g., start: "22:00", end: "07:00", days: ["Sat", "Sun"]
  };
  analysis?: { // Agent-specific section
    depth?: 'quick' | 'standard' | 'comprehensive';
    riskTolerance?: 'conservative' | 'moderate' | 'aggressive';
    complexityLevel?: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
    enabledStrategyTypes?: string[]; // e.g., ['value_investing', 'growth_investing']
  };
  dataSources?: { // Agent-specific section
    preferredNewsProviders?: string[];
    geographicFocus?: string[]; // e.g., ['US', 'EU']
    enabledDataInputs?: string[]; // e.g., ['technical', 'fundamental', 'sentiment']
  };
  performanceTuning?: { // Agent-specific section
    responsePreference?: 'fastest_cache' | 'balanced' | 'most_accurate_realtime';
    updateFrequencyMinutes?: number;
    marketSensitivity?: number; // e.g., 1-10 scale
  };
  // ... other agent-specific setting blocks
}
```

### Database Considerations:
-   Store user-specific agent settings in `StockPulse_PostgreSQL`, preferably in a structured way (e.g., JSONB column or dedicated tables per agent type if settings are very complex and varied). Include versioning for audit trails and potential rollbacks.
-   Cache active settings for frequently accessed agents in `StockPulse_Redis` to ensure fast retrieval by agents.
-   Implement a settings migration system if underlying setting schemas are expected to evolve over time.

### AI Agent Integration:
-   AI agents must be designed to be configurable. They need to fetch their specific settings at startup and subscribe to updates if dynamic reconfiguration is required.
-   Settings changes should trigger immediate (or near real-time) updates to relevant agent behaviors, potentially via A2A communication or by re-fetching configuration from the cache/DB after a notification.
-   Implement robust settings validation at the agent level to prevent invalid or conflicting configurations from disrupting agent operation.
-   The range of configurable settings and how agents interpret them must align with the principles of user control, transparency, and safety outlined in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`. Agents should have sensible default behaviors if settings are not configured or are invalid.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Start with high-impact, easily understood settings. Avoid overwhelming users initially.
-   Provide clear, concise explanations and examples for each setting, detailing its potential impact.
-   Consider using progressive disclosure for more advanced or technical settings.
-   Think about providing settings templates or presets for common user types or goals (e.g., "Conservative Investor Profile").
-   Ensure that no combination of settings can compromise critical safety, security, or compliance functions of the platform or the agents.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 7: AI Agent Interaction & Personalization](../epic-7.md)
-   Story 7.1 (Develop AI Agent Hub Dashboard) for providing the primary access point to agent settings.
-   Story 7.7 (Develop AI Meta-Agent/Orchestrator Backend) or a dedicated settings service for managing, persisting, and serving agent configurations and handling update propagation.
-   Individual AI agents (from other epics) must be designed to implement settings consumption logic and expose what is configurable.
-   A robust notification infrastructure (if agent notification preferences are to be granularly controlled).
-   Guidance from `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` for principles of configurability and agent behavior modification.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Defining the optimal level of configurability for each agent: balancing user empowerment with simplicity and avoiding cognitive overload.
-   Ensuring agent behavior changes predictably, understandably, and safely based on user settings.
-   The technical complexity of making some AI agents (especially those with complex internal models) highly configurable without performance degradation.
-   Scope Management: Which specific agents will have configurable settings in the initial release, and what will be the exact set of initial settings for them?
-   How to handle interdependencies between settings, if any.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Reliability:** Settings must be reliably saved, persisted, and applied by agents.
-   **Usability:** The settings interface must be highly intuitive and easy to navigate for users of varying technical proficiency.
-   **Security:** User-specific settings must be stored securely and protected from unauthorized access or modification.
-   **Performance:** Loading settings UI and applying changes should be fast. Agents fetching settings should not be a bottleneck.

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for this Story)
-   AI-powered settings recommendations based on user behavior, stated goals, or peer group analysis.
-   Ability to import/export agent settings configurations.
-   Conditional settings that adapt based on market conditions or user-defined rules.
-   Functionality for users to share (anonymized) settings configurations or templates.
-   A/B testing frameworks for evaluating the impact of different settings on user engagement or outcomes.
-   More advanced AI models for suggesting optimal settings to users.
