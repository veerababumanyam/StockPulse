# Story 6.6: Integrate Financial News Feeds & Basic Sentiment Scoring

**As a** system (StockPulse platform, its AI agents, and users seeking market context),
**I need** to integrate real-time financial news feeds from multiple reputable sources and perform basic sentiment analysis on news articles,
**So that** users can stay informed of market-moving news, AI agents can incorporate news sentiment into their analyses, and the platform can provide timely, relevant news alongside other data.

## Description
This story involves setting up connections to financial news APIs, ingesting news articles, processing them for relevance to specific companies or markets, and performing an initial, basic sentiment scoring (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) on the headlines and/or content.

Key features include:
-   Identify and integrate with financial news API providers (e.g., NewsAPI.org, Alpha Vantage for news, specialized financial news vendors like Benzinga, Reuters, Bloomberg API if accessible).
-   Fetch real-time news articles, including headlines, summaries, full content (if available), publication timestamps, and source information.
-   Process news articles to tag them with relevant company symbols, market sectors, or keywords.
-   Implement a basic sentiment analysis model/service (could be a pre-trained model, a cloud AI service, or a simple lexicon-based approach initially) to assign a sentiment score (e.g., -1 to +1 or categorical) to each article.
-   Store news articles, their metadata (symbols, tags, source, timestamp), and sentiment scores in a suitable database (e.g., `StockPulse_PostgreSQL` for metadata, `StockPulse_VectorDB` for article text and embeddings to support RAG in other stories).
-   Develop ETL processes for continuous news ingestion and processing.
-   Provide an internal mechanism or API for other services to query news articles by symbol, date, sentiment, or keywords.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: News Feed Integration:** The system successfully connects to and fetches news articles from the chosen news API provider(s).
2.  **AC2: News Processing & Tagging:** News articles are processed to identify and tag relevant company symbols or market keywords.
3.  **AC3: Basic Sentiment Analysis:** A sentiment score (e.g., positive/negative/neutral or a numeric score) is generated for each processed news article.
4.  **AC4: Data Storage:** Processed news articles, metadata (symbols, tags, source, timestamp), and sentiment scores are stored appropriately (e.g., `StockPulse_PostgreSQL`, `StockPulse_VectorDB`).
5.  **AC5: Real-time Ingestion:** News is ingested and processed in near real-time or with minimal delay from publication.
6.  **AC6: Error Handling:** The news ingestion and sentiment analysis pipeline includes error handling and logging.
7.  **AC7: Data Accessibility:** News articles and sentiment data are accessible via the internal Data Access API Layer (Story 6.9) for use by AI agents and UI components.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   Financial news feed integration and basic sentiment scoring are operational.
-   News articles are being ingested, processed, tagged, sentiment-scored, and stored.
-   Data is accessible internally.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and unit/integration tests passed.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) confirms news articles and sentiment scores are available and appear reasonable for sample companies/topics.

## AI Integration Details

-   News sentiment is a key input for many AI models predicting market movements or assessing company outlook.
-   The text of news articles stored in `StockPulse_VectorDB` will be used by RAG-enabled AI agents for contextual understanding and generating summaries/insights (as in Story 4.4).
-   More advanced AI-driven NLP tasks (e.g., named entity recognition, event extraction, advanced sentiment/topic modeling) can build upon this foundation in later stories or epics.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Enables UI features displaying company-specific news, market news feeds, and sentiment indicators (handled in other epics/stories).

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 6: Data Sources & Market Integration](../epic-6.md)
-   `StockPulse_PostgreSQL` and `StockPulse_VectorDB` setup.
-   API keys/access for chosen news providers.
-   Potentially a basic sentiment analysis tool/library or cloud service access.
-   Story 6.9 (Design & Implement Internal Data Access API Layer).

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Selection of news provider(s): Balancing cost, coverage (sources, languages), API quality, and licensing/redistribution rights.
-   Accuracy and nuance of basic sentiment analysis (can be challenging; managing expectations is key).
-   Volume of news data and storage implications.
-   Defining the scope of "basic" sentiment analysis â€“ what level of sophistication is targeted for this initial implementation?
-   Handling paywalled content or restrictions on full article access from some providers.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Timeliness:** News ingestion should be near real-time.
-   **Relevance:** News tagging to symbols/topics should be accurate.
-   **Scalability:** System should handle a high volume of news articles from multiple sources.
