# Story 7.2: Implement Agent Activity Feed with User-Friendly Logging

**As a** user,
**I want** to see a chronological activity feed showing recent key actions and insights from my AI agents in simple, understandable language,
**So that** I can track how they're helping me, understand their recent contributions, and maintain transparency over AI operations.

## Business Context:
This story provides transparency into AI agent activities by translating technical actions into user-friendly narratives. This builds trust and helps users understand the value provided by AI agents over time.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1.  **AC1: Activity Feed Display & Structure:**
    *   A dedicated UI component or page for the Agent Activity Feed is implemented and accessible (e.g., within or linked from the AI Agent Hub - Story 7.1).
    *   The feed displays AI agent activities in reverse chronological order.
    *   Activities are visually grouped by day with clear date headers.
    *   The feed initially loads a reasonable number of recent activities (e.g., last 50) with pagination or infinite scroll for older activities.

2.  **AC2: User-Friendly Activity Descriptions & Content:**
    *   Each activity entry clearly indicates the originating AI agent name and timestamp.
    *   Technical agent actions are translated into plain English, user-friendly descriptions (e.g., "Portfolio Analysis Agent reviewed your holdings and found 3 diversification opportunities" instead of "vector_similarity_search executed on portfolio_holdings").
    *   Descriptions include context relevant to the user's goals and focus on benefits or outcomes where applicable.
    *   Language used is action-oriented.

3.  **AC3: Activity Filtering and Search:**
    *   Users can filter activities by agent type/name.
    *   Users can filter activities by a predefined time range (e.g., Today, This Week, This Month).
    *   Basic search functionality is available for finding specific activities or topics within the feed.
    *   A toggle to "Show only high-impact activities" or filter by activity priority is available.

4.  **AC4: Activity Detail Views & Contextual Links:**
    *   Users can click to expand an activity entry for more details (if available).
    *   Where applicable, activity entries provide direct links to related insights, recommendations, or relevant sections/entities within the application (e.g., link to a stock page, portfolio view, or a specific AI-generated report).
    *   If relevant and user-appropriate, data sources used for an insight might be mentioned in user-friendly terms.

5.  **AC5: Activity Categorization & Visualization:**
    *   Activities are visually categorized (e.g., Analysis, Recommendations, Alerts, Background Updates, Security Notes) using clear icons and potentially color-coding.
    *   Priority indicators (e.g., for important alerts or recommendations) are displayed.

6.  **AC6: Performance and Real-time Updates:**
    *   The activity feed loads quickly, even with a significant history.
    *   New activities appear in the feed in real-time or near real-time (e.g., via WebSocket) with optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback where appropriate.

## Technical Guidance:

### Frontend Implementation:
-   **Framework:** React/TypeScript.
-   **Performance:** Employ techniques like virtual scrolling if feed lists become very long.
-   **State Management:** Utilize React Query or similar for caching, background updates, and managing real-time data from WebSockets.
-   **UI Components:** Develop a reusable timeline/feed component with expansion capabilities, adhering to the StockPulse design system.
-   **Real-time Updates:** Implement WebSocket connection (e.g., to `/ws/agent-activities`) for live activity streaming.

### API Endpoints (to be provided by AI Meta-Agent - Story 7.7):
-   `GET /api/ai-agents/activities`: Retrieve paginated activity feed for the authenticated user, with support for filtering parameters (agent, date range, priority, search term).
-   `GET /api/ai-agents/activities/{activityId}`: Retrieve detailed information for a specific activity entry.
-   `GET /api/ai-agents/activities/summary` (Optional): Retrieve activity statistics and highlights if needed for a summary view elsewhere.

### Activity Data Model (Illustrative - to be finalized with backend):
```typescript
interface AgentActivity {
  id: string; // Unique activity ID
  agentId: string; // ID of the agent that performed the action
  agentName: string; // User-friendly name of the agent
  timestamp: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp
  category: 'analysis' | 'recommendation' | 'alert' | 'background_update' | 'security'; // Activity category
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'; // Activity priority
  userFriendlyDescription: string; // Main text shown in the feed
  detailDescription?: string; // Optional further details on expansion
  impactStatement?: string; // Optional summary of the impact or outcome
  relatedEntityId?: string; // ID of a related entity (e.g., stock ticker, portfolio ID)
  relatedEntityType?: 'stock' | 'portfolio' | 'order' | 'news_item' | 'user_setting';
  relatedEntityLink?: string; // Direct link to the related entity in the UI
  dataSourcesUsed?: string[]; // User-friendly list of key data sources involved
  actionRequired?: boolean; // Flag if the activity suggests user action
}
```

### Database Considerations:
-   Agent activity logs should be stored in `StockPulse_PostgreSQL` with efficient indexing on user_id, timestamp, agent_id, and category/priority for filtering.
-   Consider caching recent or frequently accessed activities in `StockPulse_Redis` for fast retrieval by the API.
-   Implement a data retention policy for activity logs (e.g., keep detailed user-facing logs for 90-180 days, older logs might be archived or summarized).

### AI Agent & Backend Integration:
-   Each AI agent must be designed to emit structured loggable events/actions with all necessary details for constructing user-friendly feed entries.
-   A standardized logging interface/library should be used by all AI agents.
-   The AI Meta-Agent/Orchestrator (Story 7.7) will be responsible for collecting these raw agent events, processing/transforming them (potentially using RAG or other NLP techniques for generating `userFriendlyDescription` and `impactStatement` based on user profile and context), and storing them in the `AgentActivity` format.
-   The AI Meta-Agent then exposes the activities via the defined API endpoints.
-   Adherence to logging standards and user-centric communication principles from `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` is crucial for all contributing agents.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   The feed must be exceptionally easy to scan and understand at a glance.
-   Avoid technical jargon or overly complex language in activity descriptions. Focus on clarity and user value.
-   Prioritize displaying the most important and user-relevant agent activities. The "high-impact" filter is key here.
-   Consider user's potential technical sophistication level when crafting language.
-   Ensure activities clearly articulate the value proposition or benefit to the user.
-   Balance the level of detail: informative but not overwhelming in the main feed view.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 7: AI Agent Interaction & Personalization](../epic-7.md)
-   Story 7.1 (Develop AI Agent Hub Dashboard) as this feed might be integrated into or linked from the hub.
-   Story 7.7 (Develop AI Meta-Agent/Orchestrator Backend) - critical for collecting, processing, and providing the agent activity logs.
-   Individual AI agents (from other epics) must be designed to emit structured loggable events with sufficient detail.
-   WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates.
-   Guidance from `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` for logging standards and communication style.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Defining precisely what constitutes a "key" or "significant" or "high-impact" agent activity to log â€“ requires careful thought to avoid excessive noise while capturing true value.
-   Establishing and enforcing standardized formats for loggable events across diverse AI agents.
-   Ensuring the language used in the feed is consistently user-friendly, valuable, and non-repetitive.
-   Scalability of real-time processing and delivery if activity volume is very high.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Performance:** Activity feed must load quickly and support smooth scrolling/pagination even with a large history of activities.
-   **Clarity & Readability:** Log entries must be unambiguous and easily digestible.
-   **Timeliness:** New activities should appear in the feed with minimal (seconds) delay.
-   **Accuracy:** Feed entries must accurately reflect agent actions and insights.

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for this Story)
-   AI-powered activity summarization (e.g., daily/weekly digests for the user).
-   Personalized activity relevance scoring and sorting.
-   Ability for users to share specific activities (if appropriate).
-   Exportable activity reports (e.g., PDF, CSV).
-   Activity-based notifications and reminders (e.g., if an action is required).
-   Machine learning models for continuously improving the quality and relevance of activity descriptions.
