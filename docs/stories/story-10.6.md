# Story 10.6: System Configuration & Feature Flag Management

**Epic:** Epic 10: Platform Administration & Observability
**Story ID:** 10.6
**Story Title:** System Configuration & Feature Flag Management
**Assigned to:** DevOps Team, Backend Team, Frontend Team
**Story Points:** 9

## Business Context
As a StockPulse platform administrator, I need a centralized and secure system to manage global system configurations, application settings, and feature flags. This allows for controlled rollout of new features, A/B testing, dynamic adjustment of platform behavior without deployments, and quick rollback of problematic changes, ensuring platform stability and operational agility.

## User Story
**As a** platform administrator
**I want to** have a centralized system for managing system configurations and feature flags
**So that** I can safely control platform behavior, roll out features incrementally, conduct A/B tests, and quickly adapt settings without requiring new code deployments, enhancing operational flexibility and stability.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Centralized Configuration Management
- A central repository for storing all global system configurations and application settings (e.g., API rate limits, default AGI model parameters, third-party service credentials - securely managed).
- Version control for all configuration changes, with history and rollback capabilities.
- Secure storage for sensitive configuration values (e.g., using a secrets management system like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Hierarchical configuration support (e.g., global defaults overridden by environment-specific or service-specific settings).
- Mechanisms for applications and services to fetch their configurations dynamically at startup or runtime.
- Clear distinction between static (requiring restart) and dynamic (hot-reloadable) configurations.

### 2. Feature Flag System Implementation
- A robust feature flag system allowing administrators to toggle features on/off for all users or specific segments.
- Support for different types of feature flags: boolean toggles, multivariate flags (for A/B testing different feature variations), percentage-based rollouts.
- User segmentation for feature flags based on attributes (e.g., user role, geography, subscription tier, early access list).
- Gradual rollout capabilities (e.g., enable for 10% of users, then 50%, then 100%).
- Emergency kill switches for critical features that can be activated instantly.
- SDKs or libraries for backend and frontend applications to easily consume and react to feature flag states.

### 3. Admin UI for Configuration & Feature Flags
- A secure web interface for authorized administrators to view and manage system configurations and feature flags.
- Intuitive UI for creating, editing, enabling/disabling feature flags and defining targeting rules.
- Display of current configuration values and feature flag states across different environments (dev, staging, prod).
- Audit trail (linking to Story 10.5) for all changes made to configurations and feature flags (who changed what, when).
- Search and filtering capabilities for managing a large number of configurations and flags.
- Role-based access control for managing configurations and feature flags (e.g., only super-admins can change critical system configs).

### 4. A/B Testing Support via Feature Flags
- Ability to use multivariate feature flags to serve different versions of a feature to different user segments for A/B testing.
- Integration with analytics systems to measure the impact of different feature variations on key metrics.
- Easy way to ramp up traffic to a winning variation and roll back losing ones.
- Clear reporting on which users are part of which A/B test group through the feature flag system.
- Support for session stickiness to ensure users consistently see the same feature variation during an A/B test.

### 5. Dynamic Configuration Updates & Hot Reloading
- For designated configurations, applications can pick up changes dynamically without requiring a restart or redeployment.
- Mechanisms for services to subscribe to configuration changes and react accordingly.
- Safe rollout strategies for dynamic configuration changes (e.g., apply to a subset of instances first).
- Monitoring of services to ensure they correctly apply new configurations.
- Fallback to default or last known good configuration in case of errors fetching new configurations.

### 6. Governance & Lifecycle Management of Flags/Configs
- Clear naming conventions and descriptions for all feature flags and configurations.
- A defined lifecycle for feature flags (e.g., temporary, permanent, experiment, release toggle), including a process for retiring old or obsolete flags.
- Regular review of existing feature flags to remove technical debt associated with unused flags.
- Documentation for each configuration parameter and feature flag, explaining its purpose and impact.
- Ownership assigned to each feature flag or configuration group.
- Security considerations for feature flags that control access to sensitive data or functionality.

GET /api/v1/admin/config/{config_key}
POST /api/v1/admin/config/{config_key}/update
GET /api/v1/admin/featureflags/{flag_name}/status
POST /api/v1/admin/featureflags/{flag_name}/toggle
POST /api/v1/admin/featureflags/create
GET /api/v1/app/config # Endpoint for apps to fetch their config

# Key Functions
async def get_system_configuration_value(key, environment)
async def update_system_configuration_value(key, value, admin_user_id)
async def evaluate_feature_flag_for_user(flag_name, user_context)
async def manage_feature_flag_rollout_rules(flag_name, rules)
async def notify_services_of_config_change(config_key_changed)
async def audit_config_feature_flag_change(admin_user_id, item_name, old_value, new_value)
```

### Frontend Implementation (TypeScript/React) - (Config & Feature Flag Management UI)
```typescript
interface ConfigFeatureFlagManagerDashboard {
  systemConfigs: SystemConfigEntry[];
  featureFlags: FeatureFlagEntry[];
  selectedConfigForEdit: SystemConfigEntry | null;
  selectedFlagForEdit: FeatureFlagEntry | null;
  auditLog: ConfigChangeLogEntry[]; // Filtered from main audit log
}

interface SystemConfigEntry {
  key: string;
  value: any;
  description: string;
  environment: string; // e.g., 'prod', 'staging'
  isSensitive: boolean;
  lastModified: Date;
  modifiedBy: string;
}

interface FeatureFlagEntry {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  isEnabled: boolean;
  rolloutPercentage?: number;
  targetingRules?: UserSegmentRule[]; // e.g., { attribute: 'role', operator: 'EQUALS', value: 'premium_user' }
  type: 'boolean' | 'multivariate';
  variations?: { key: string; name: string; percentageSplit?: number }[];
  lastModified: Date;
  modifiedBy: string;
}
```

### AI Integration Components
- AI-powered suggestions for optimal rollout percentages for new features based on risk assessment.
- Anomaly detection for unexpected impacts of configuration changes or feature flag toggles.
- AI to help identify stale or unused feature flags for cleanup.
- **Agent Design:** Adhere to principles in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` if AGI agents' configurations are managed here, or if AI assists in managing configurations/flags.

### Database Schema Updates

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Administrators can view and modify at least one global system configuration parameter via a UI or API.
- [ ] A simple boolean feature flag can be created and toggled on/off via a UI or API.
- [ ] An application component (backend or frontend) correctly alters its behavior based on the state of the feature flag.
- [ ] Changes to configurations and feature flags are logged in an audit trail.
- [ ] Version history for one configuration parameter is maintained and viewable.
- [ ] Secure handling for at least one sensitive configuration value is demonstrated (e.g., stored in a mock secrets manager).
- [ ] A feature flag can be targeted to a specific user segment (e.g., based on a user attribute like `is_beta_user`).
- [ ] Documentation for managing configurations and feature flags is available.

## Dependencies
- Platform Administrator User Management System (Story 10.2) - for RBAC on this system.
- Comprehensive Audit Logging & Review System (Story 10.5) - for auditing changes.
- Secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider KMS/Secrets Manager).
- Client libraries/SDKs for applications to consume flags/configs.
- `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` for AI agent design and fine-tuning best practices.

## Notes
- This system is critical for agile development, safe rollouts, and operational flexibility.
- Start with a simple key-value store and boolean flags, then expand to more complex scenarios.
- Performance of fetching configurations and evaluating feature flags is important, especially for high-traffic applications.
- Ensure clear separation between configuration (how the system runs) and feature flags (what features are visible).

## Future Enhancements
- GitOps-style management of configurations and feature flags.
- Automated A/B testing analysis and reporting integrated with the feature flag system.
- Machine learning-driven feature flag rollouts (e.g., automated ramp-up based on success metrics).
- SDKs for more languages and platforms.
- UI for visualizing feature flag dependencies or potential conflicts.
- "Dark launching" capabilities where features are deployed to production but hidden until explicitly enabled.
