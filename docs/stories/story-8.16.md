# Story 8.16: Implement Bayesian Risk Modeling Agent

**Epic:** [Epic 8: Enhanced AI Agents & Intelligence](../epic-8.md)

**Status:** To Do

**Priority:** High

**Estimated Effort:** 18 Story Points (4.5 weeks)

## User Story

**As a** portfolio manager or risk analyst
**I want** an AI agent that uses Bayesian inference to dynamically model and predict risks in real-time
**So that** I can adapt to changing market conditions, detect regime shifts early, and make data-driven risk management decisions with quantified uncertainty

## Description

Implement an advanced AI agent that employs Bayesian inference techniques to model financial risks dynamically. This agent continuously updates risk predictions as new market data arrives, detects regime changes, models tail risks, and provides uncertainty quantification for all risk assessments.

The agent integrates with the AG-UI framework to generate dynamic risk visualization interfaces that adapt based on current risk levels and market conditions, providing users with contextually relevant risk information and actionable insights.
