# Story 14.3: Hierarchical & Associative Memory Structures

**Epic:** Epic 14: AGI Context & Memory Systems
**Story ID:** 14.3
**Story Title:** Hierarchical & Associative Memory Structures
**Assigned to:** AI Research Team  
**Story Points:** 13

## Business Context
As an AGI developer, I need to design and implement hierarchical and associative memory structures that allow AGI agents to organize information effectively, from fine-grained details to abstract concepts, and to form rich connections between disparate pieces of knowledge. This is crucial for enabling human-like understanding, generalization, and creative problem-solving. ([Source: User stories with examples and a template, Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories))

## User Story
**As an** AGI developer  
**I want to** implement hierarchical and associative memory structures within the AGI  
**So that** agents can organize knowledge from specific details to broad concepts, create meaningful links between information, and ultimately exhibit more nuanced understanding and flexible reasoning.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Multi-Levelled Hierarchical Abstraction
- Implementation of mechanisms for AGI to form and utilize conceptual hierarchies (e.g., "Apple Inc." is a "Tech Company" is a "Corporation").
- Ability to store and retrieve information at different levels of abstraction.
- Dynamic abstraction capabilities, where AGI can create new hierarchical levels based on experience.
- Support for both top-down (general to specific) and bottom-up (specific to general) reasoning using hierarchies.
- Integration with the Knowledge Graph (Story 14.1) to represent and query hierarchies.
- Scalability of hierarchical structures to accommodate vast amounts of information.

### 2. Rich Associative Linking Engine
- Development of an engine that allows AGI to create and strengthen associations between any two pieces of information (nodes, concepts, experiences, etc.) in its memory.
- Associations can be typed (e.g., `causes`, `correlatesWith`, `isSimilarTo`, `isAntonymOf`).
- Associative strength can vary based on co-occurrence, causal links, or learned relevance.
- Spreading activation or similar mechanisms for traversing associative networks to retrieve related information.
- Ability to form higher-order associations (associations between associations).
- Tools for visualizing and exploring associative networks within the AGI's memory.

### 3. Context-Dependent Association & Retrieval
- Associative retrieval that is sensitive to the AGI's current context, goals, and attention.
- Mechanisms to prime or bias associative pathways based on recent experiences or current tasks.
- Suppression of irrelevant associations to maintain focus and cognitive efficiency.
- Dynamic weighting of associations based on their relevance to the active context.
- Support for context-specific meanings of concepts (polysemy).
- Ability for AGI to learn which associations are most useful in different contexts.

### 4. Temporal & Sequential Memory Associations
- Specialized mechanisms for encoding and retrieving sequences of events or information (episodic memory links - Story 14.4).
- Ability to learn temporal dependencies and causal chains from sequential data.
- Support for associating information based on temporal proximity or ordering.
- Retrieval of entire event sequences or segments based on partial cues.
- Integration with procedural memory (Story 14.5) for learning and executing sequences of actions.
- Representation of time at multiple scales (e.g., seconds, days, years) within associative structures.

### 5. Cross-Modal Associations
- Ability to form associations between information from different modalities (e.g., associating the image of a stock chart pattern with a textual news headline and a specific market event).
- Linking semantic concepts (Story 14.1) with sensory experiences or raw data patterns.
- Retrieval of related information across modalities (e.g., hearing a company name and retrieving its logo and recent news).
- Support for analogical reasoning by finding structural similarities between associatively linked concepts from different domains.
- Integration with multi-modal knowledge in the KG (Story 14.1).
- Framework for learning cross-modal associative mappings.

### 6. Pruning & Reorganization of Memory Structures
- Mechanisms for AGI to prune weak, irrelevant, or outdated associations and hierarchical links.
- Automated reorganization of memory structures based on new learning and experiences to improve efficiency and coherence.
- Forgetting mechanisms for information that is no longer relevant or accessed (managed decay).
- Consolidation processes that strengthen important hierarchical and associative pathways.
- Human-in-the-loop tools for reviewing and guiding memory reorganization processes.
- Balance between plasticity (ability to learn new structures) and stability (preserving important knowledge).

### AI Integration Components
- Graph database extensions for typed relationships and hierarchical queries.
- Algorithms for learning hierarchical representations (e.g., from text, from interaction).
- Spreading activation network implementations.
- Hebbian learning or similar mechanisms for strengthening associations.
- Reinforcement learning for context-dependent association weighting.
- Techniques for memory consolidation and forgetting (e.g., inspired by neural replay).
- **Agent Design:** The way AGI agents leverage these hierarchical and associative memory structures for reasoning, learning, and problem-solving is a critical aspect of their cognitive architecture, as specified in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`.

### Database Schema Updates (Extends KG from Story 14.1)
```sql
-- These are conceptual; primary representation is in the graph DB
-- Add properties to KG nodes and relationships to support these structures

-- Example property for a KG Node:
-- 'abstraction_level': 3
-- 'parent_concept_id': 'uuid_of_parent'

-- Example properties for a KG Relationship (Association):
-- 'association_type': 'correlatesWith_positive'
-- 'association_strength': 0.85
-- 'context_tags': ['market_rally', 'fed_announcement']
-- 'last_reinforced_at': 'timestamp'

CREATE TABLE agi_memory_hierarchies (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    child_node_id VARCHAR(255), -- In KG
    parent_node_id VARCHAR(255), -- In KG
    hierarchy_type VARCHAR(100), -- e.g., 'isA', 'partOf', 'composedOf'
    confidence DECIMAL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE agi_memory_associations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    source_node_id VARCHAR(255), -- In KG or other memory store
    target_node_id VARCHAR(255),
    association_type VARCHAR(100),
    strength DECIMAL,
    context JSONB, -- Relevant contextual factors
    is_cross_modal BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_accessed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
