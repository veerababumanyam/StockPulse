# Story 13.4: Verifiable AGI Safety & Control Mechanisms

**Epic:** Epic 13: AGI Safety & Ethics
**Story ID:** 13.4
**Story Title:** Verifiable AGI Safety & Control Mechanisms
**Assigned to:** Development Team, Safety Assurance Team  
**Story Points:** 12

## Business Context
As a StockPulse platform operator, I need robust and formally verifiable AGI safety and control mechanisms to ensure that our AGI systems operate within predefined safety boundaries, allow for human intervention and oversight, and prevent unintended or harmful actions, especially in complex and rapidly evolving financial markets. This is crucial for maintaining user trust, regulatory compliance, and the overall integrity of the platform.

## User Story
**As a** platform operator  
**I want to** implement verifiable safety and control mechanisms for all AGI systems  
**So that** I can ensure AGI agents operate within secure boundaries, allow for reliable human intervention, and prevent any unintended harmful outcomes, thereby safeguarding user assets and market stability.
