# Story 8.7: (Future) Integrate and Analyze [Specific Alternative Data Source] with AI

**As a** system (AI Alternative Data Analyst Agent) and as a user (quant analyst or sophisticated investor),
**I may want** to integrate and analyze specific alternative datasets (e.g., social media sentiment, ESG scores, supply chain disruption data, geolocation data, etc.) using AI techniques,
**So that** unique, alpha-generating insights can be uncovered, and richer contextual understanding can be added to traditional financial analysis.

## Description
This story is a placeholder for the future integration and AI-driven analysis of a specific, high-value alternative dataset. The exact data source, integration methods, and analytical AI models will be defined when this story is prioritized. Example alternative data sources could include advanced sentiment analysis from social media, detailed ESG controversy scores from a specialized provider, or real-time supply chain risk indicators.

Key features (to be detailed later):
-   Identification and vetting of a valuable alternative data source.
-   Data ingestion pipeline for the chosen alternative dataset (similar to Epic 6 stories for traditional data).
-   Development or fine-tuning of AI models (e.g., NLP, anomaly detection, correlation analysis) by the "AI Alternative Data Analyst Agent" to extract signals from this data.
-   Storage of processed alternative data and AI-derived insights (e.g., in `StockPulse_PostgreSQL` or `StockPulse_VectorDB`).
-   Mechanisms to present these unique insights to users, possibly through the Customizable Analytics Dashboard (Story 8.6) or as inputs to other AI agents (e.g., AI Forecasting Agent, AI Portfolio Optimizer Agent).

## Acceptance Criteria
*(To be defined when story is activated and a specific alternative data source is chosen)*

## Definition of Done (DoD)
*(To be defined when story is activated)*

## AI Integration Details

-   **AI Alternative Data Analyst Agent:** This agent would be specialized in processing the chosen alternative dataset. Techniques could include advanced NLP for text-based alternative data, image analysis for satellite data, or time-series analysis for sensor data, etc.
-   The goal is to find signals that are not easily found in traditional market or fundamental data.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   How to present insights from potentially abstract or noisy alternative data in a meaningful way.
-   Educating users on the source, methodology, and limitations of alternative data insights.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 8: Advanced Analytics & Insights](../epic-8.md)
-   Epic 6 (Data Sources & Market Integration) principles would apply for data ingestion.
-   Story 6.9 (Internal Data Access API Layer).
-   Story 7.7 (AI Meta-Agent/Orchestrator Backend).

## Open Questions/Risks
*(To be defined when story is activated)*
-   Selection of truly valuable and reliable alternative data sources (many are noisy or expensive).
-   Complexity of cleaning, processing, and extracting meaningful signals from unstructured or semi-structured alternative data.
-   Risk of overfitting models to spurious correlations in alternative data.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
*(To be defined when story is activated)*
