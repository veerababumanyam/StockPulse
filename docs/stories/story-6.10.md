# Story 6.10: (Future) Integrate Macroeconomic Data Feeds

**As a** system (StockPulse platform and its AI agents),
**I may need** to integrate various macroeconomic data feeds (e.g., GDP, inflation, unemployment, interest rates),
**So that** AI agents can perform broader economic analysis and consider macroeconomic context in their models, and users can access this information for research.

## Description
This story is a placeholder for future integration of key macroeconomic indicators from government and private sources. The specific data points, sources, and integration methods will be defined when this story is prioritized.

Key features (to be detailed later):
-   Identification of key macroeconomic indicators and reliable sources.
-   Ingestion, storage, and an API for accessing this data.

## Acceptance Criteria

## UI/UX Considerations
-   Could enable UI display of economic charts and indicators.

## Dependencies
