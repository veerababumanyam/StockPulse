# Story 15.2: Develop Collective Intelligence Framework

**Epic:** 15 - AGI Orchestration & Multi-Agent Coordination

**User Story:** As an AGI system, I need to demonstrate collective intelligence where groups of agents achieve capabilities greater than individual agents through emergent collaboration.

**Status:** To Do

## Business Context:
This story implements a collective intelligence framework that enables groups of AI agents to demonstrate capabilities, insights, and problem-solving abilities that exceed what any individual agent could achieve. This emergent intelligence is crucial for AGI-level performance in complex financial markets where multifaceted analysis and diverse perspectives create superior outcomes.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Emergent Behavior Detection and Cultivation:**
   - Automatic detection of beneficial emergent behaviors arising from agent interactions
   - Cultivation mechanisms that reinforce and amplify positive emergent intelligence patterns
   - Pattern recognition identifying when collective intelligence exceeds individual capabilities
   - Feedback loops strengthening successful collaborative behaviors

2. **Swarm Intelligence Algorithms:**
   - Implementation of swarm intelligence patterns for distributed problem-solving
   - Collective decision-making mechanisms using wisdom-of-crowds principles
   - Self-organizing agent clusters forming around specific problems or domains
   - Distributed consensus algorithms enabling coherent group decisions

3. **Collaborative Reasoning Engine:**
   - Multi-agent reasoning frameworks combining diverse analytical approaches
   - Dialectical reasoning systems where agents challenge and refine each other's conclusions
   - Synthesis mechanisms integrating multiple perspectives into coherent insights
   - Cross-validation systems ensuring collective conclusions are robust

4. **Collective Memory and Knowledge Integration:**
   - Shared memory systems enabling seamless knowledge access across agent groups
   - Collective learning mechanisms where individual agent improvements benefit the group
   - Knowledge synthesis engines combining insights from multiple agents
   - Emergent knowledge creation through agent collaboration

5. **Performance Amplification Metrics:**
   - Quantitative measurement of collective intelligence vs individual agent performance
   - Tracking of problem-solving capabilities that emerge only through collaboration
   - Performance scaling metrics as more agents join collaborative efforts
   - Quality assessment of decisions made through collective intelligence

6. **Dynamic Group Formation:**
   - Automatic formation of agent groups based on problem requirements and agent capabilities
   - Optimal group size determination for different types of problems
   - Dynamic membership adjustment as problems evolve or new agents become available
   - Specialization emergence within groups for complex multi-faceted problems

## Technical Guidance:
