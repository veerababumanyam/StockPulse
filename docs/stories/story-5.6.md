# Story 5.6: Implement Real-time Order Status Updates & Notifications with AI Context

**As a** user (active trader or investor),
**I want** to receive real-time updates on my open order statuses and prominent notifications for significant order events (fills, rejections, cancellations), with relevant AI-generated context or commentary where applicable,
**So that** I am promptly and comprehensively informed about my trading activity and its implications, enhanced by AI insights.

## Description
This story focuses on delivering real-time order status updates and notifications to the user. A key enhancement is the inclusion of AI-generated context alongside these notifications, providing users with more than just factual updates. For example, a fill notification might include a brief AI note on how the fill price relates to recent volatility or a pre-set target.

Key features include:
-   Real-time order status updates in relevant UI sections (e.g., Open Orders view) via WebSockets.
-   Toast/pop-up notifications for key order events: Partial Fill, Full Fill, Rejection, Cancellation.
-   **AI-Contextualized Notifications:**
    -   For Fills: AI might comment if the fill price was favorable compared to a short-term benchmark, or if it aligns with a goal set during AI-assisted order entry (e.g., "Fill achieved near AI-suggested target price.").
    -   For Rejections: AI might provide a slightly more descriptive reason or suggest a common fix if the rejection code is known (e.g., "Order rejected: Insufficient funds. Consider depositing or reducing order size.").
    -   For Cancellations: AI context might be minimal, but could confirm if a cancel request for an AI-suggested order was processed.
-   Notifications are dismissible and may link to the order or trade history.
-   Optional Notification Center for historical review of notifications.
-   Robust WebSocket connection management.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Real-time UI Updates:** The status of open orders in the UI (e.g., Open Orders page) updates in real-time upon receiving backend WebSocket messages.
2.  **AC2: AI-Contextualized Fill Notifications:** When an order is filled (partially or fully), a toast notification displays fill details AND a concise AI-generated comment (e.g., relating to price, AI targets, or market context).
3.  **AC3: AI-Contextualized Rejection Notifications:** When an order is rejected, a toast notification displays the rejection reason AND, if applicable, a brief AI-generated explanation or common next step.
4.  **AC4: Standard Cancellation Notifications:** When an order is cancelled, a toast notification confirms the cancellation (AI context here might be less critical but can be included if relevant).
5.  **AC5: Clarity and Attribution of AI Context:** AI-generated comments in notifications are clearly identifiable as such, are concise, and add value without causing confusion.
6.  **AC6: WebSocket Robustness:** The system manages WebSocket connections reliably, with reconnection attempts and user feedback on connection status if issues arise.
7.  **AC7 (Optional - Notification Center):** A Notification Center allows users to review a history of received notifications, including any AI context provided.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All core Acceptance Criteria met.
-   Real-time order status updates are functional in the UI.
-   Users receive toast notifications for key order events, enriched with AI context where appropriate.
-   AI integration for contextualizing notifications is working.
-   WebSocket connection and notification display are robust and user-friendly.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and unit/integration tests passed.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) has approved the functionality, especially the AI-contextualized notifications.

## AI Integration Details

-   **Agent:** AI Trade Advisor Agent (and potentially a more general Notification Formatting Agent).
-   **Task:** Provide contextual commentary for order event notifications.
-   **Models:** LLM for generating concise, relevant text for notifications.
-   **Data Sources for AI Context:**
    -   `StockPulse_PostgreSQL`: Order details (including original AI intent/parameters if stored), user portfolio.
    -   `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`: Recent market data (e.g., volatility, price movement around fill time).
    -   Backend Notification Service: Receives raw order event data.
-   **Flow for AI-Contextualized Notifications:**
    1.  Backend (Order Management Service) detects a significant order event (fill, rejection).
    2.  Before sending a WebSocket message or triggering a standard notification, it can optionally call the AI Trade Advisor Agent.
    3.  The Agent receives event details (e.g., fill price, rejection reason) and original order context (e.g., was it an AI-assisted order? What was the goal?).
    4.  Agent generates a brief contextual comment (e.g., "Fill price is 1% above 5-min VWAP," or "Rejection due to insufficient funds; current buying power is $X.").
    5.  This comment is added to the payload sent via WebSocket and/or used by the Notification Service to format the user-facing notification.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Notifications must be timely and clear.
-   AI context should be very concise (1-2 short sentences max for a toast).
-   Clear visual distinction for AI-provided text within a notification if needed.
-   Avoid AI comments that are generic or unhelpful.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 5: Trading & Order Management](../epic-5.md)
-   WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates from the backend.
-   AI Trade Advisor Agent (backend logic - Story 5.7) capable of generating contextual comments for order events.
-   UI components for displaying toast notifications and (optionally) a Notification Center.
-   Story 5.4 (Develop Open Orders Management View) for UI integration of live status.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Defining the precise triggers and content for AI-contextualized comments (needs to be genuinely useful).
-   Latency: Ensuring AI context generation doesn't significantly delay notifications.
-   Crafting AI comments that are helpful and not alarming or misleading.
-   Keeping AI comments fresh and varied to avoid repetitiveness.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Real-time:** Notifications should appear with minimal delay after the event occurs.
-   **Reliability:** Notification system must be reliable.
-   **Clarity:** Information, including AI context, must be unambiguous.
