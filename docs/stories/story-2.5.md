## 2. Requirements

*   The widget must be selectable and placeable on the dashboard via the Customizable Widget System (Story 2.2).
*   The widget will be powered by the "Market Insights AI Agent."
*   **RAG-Powered Insights:** The agent will utilize a RAG pipeline with `StockPulse_VectorDB` (containing news, market analysis, financial documents, etc.) to generate insights.
*   The panel should display a variety of insights, including but not limited to:
    *   Overall market sentiment (e.g., Bullish, Bearish, Neutral with a brief RAG-informed explanation).
    *   Potentially trending sectors or industries based on RAG analysis.
    *   Specific stock signals (e.g., "AAPL showing strong bullish pattern") with confidence scores and RAG-informed rationale.
    *   Key news-driven insights with sentiment (e.g., "Positive news sentiment for MSFT regarding new product launch, based on [retrieved source]").
*   **Natural Language Query (NLQ) Input (Optional V2/Stretch):** Include an input field allowing users to ask financial questions to the Market Insights AI Agent (e.g., "What caused the market dip yesterday?", "Explain P/E ratio for AAPL."). The agent will use RAG to answer.
*   Insights should be presented clearly and concisely.
*   Include a timestamp for each insight to indicate its recency.
*   Data should update in near real-time or at frequent intervals as new insights are generated by the backend AI engine.
*   Clicking on a specific insight (e.g., a stock signal) could lead to more detailed information (e.g., navigate to `StockDetailPage.tsx` or a dedicated analysis view).
*   Handle empty states (no new insights) or loading states gracefully.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  **AC1:** Given the "AI Insights Panel" widget is added to the dashboard, when the Market Insights AI Agent provides insights, then a list or feed of RAG-powered insights (e.g., market sentiment, stock signals, news summaries) is displayed, each with a timestamp and brief explanation/rationale.
2.  **AC2:** Given the widget is displayed, when new AI insights are generated by the backend, then the panel updates to show the latest insights without requiring a page refresh.
3.  **AC3:** Given a user clicks on a stock-specific insight in the panel, then they are navigated to the relevant `StockDetailPage.tsx` for that stock, or a more detailed analysis view if applicable.
4.  **AC4:** Given the widget is loading data, then a clear loading indicator is displayed.
5.  **AC5:** Given an error occurs while fetching AI insights, then a user-friendly error message is displayed within the widget.
6.  **AC6:** Given no new AI insights are currently available, then an appropriate message (e.g., "No new AI insights at the moment. Check back soon!") is displayed.
7.  **AC7:** Insights are clearly distinguishable by type (e.g., market sentiment vs. stock signal vs. news insight) through visual cues or labeling.
8.  **AC8 (New - NLQ, Optional V2):** If NLQ input is implemented, given a user types a financial question and submits, then the Market Insights AI Agent provides a RAG-powered answer within the panel.

    *   New Widget Component: `src/components/widgets/AIInsightsWidget.tsx`.
    *   Service: `src/services/aiAgentService.ts` (or similar) to interact with the Market Insights AI Agent (fetch proactive insights, submit NLQs).
    *   Real-time Integration: Logic to subscribe to WebSocket updates for new proactive insights or poll the API.
    *   UI Elements: Components to render different types of insight cards/items, and an optional input field for NLQ.
*   **API Endpoints Involved:**
    *   `GET /api/v1/agents/market-insights/proactive` (To fetch current proactive AI insights).
        *   Expected Response: An array of insight objects (similar to original story, but explicitly RAG-generated).
    *   `POST /api/v1/agents/market-insights/query` (For NLQ, if implemented)
        *   Request Body: `{ "userId": "uuid-user", "queryText": "Explain the recent drop in oil prices." }`
        *   Expected Response: `{ "answerText": "The recent drop in oil prices can be attributed to [RAG-informed explanation...].", "sources": [ { "title": "Source 1", "url": "..."} ] }`
    *   WebSocket endpoint for real-time proactive insight pushes (details TBD with backend).
*   **Styling/UI Notes:**
    *   Align with `StockPulse_Design.md`. Insights should be easy to scan and differentiate.
    *   Consider using icons or color-coding for different insight types.
*   **Error Handling Notes:**
    *   Handle API errors gracefully.

## 5. Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **Task 1 (AC1):** Create the basic structure for `AIInsightsWidget.tsx`.
2.  **Task 2 (AC1, AC4, AC5):** Implement service function to fetch AI insights from the backend API.

4.  **Task 4 (AC1, AC7):** Design and implement UI components to render individual insights based on their type (market sentiment, stock signal, news).
5.  **Task 5 (AC2):** Implement real-time updates for the proactive insights feed (via WebSocket or polling).
6.  **Task 6 (AC3):** Implement navigation to detailed views (e.g., `StockDetailPage.tsx`) when a relevant insight is clicked.
7.  **Task 7 (AC8 - Optional V2):** If NLQ is scoped, implement the input field and integrate the `/api/v1/agents/market-insights/query` API call, displaying the agent's answer.
