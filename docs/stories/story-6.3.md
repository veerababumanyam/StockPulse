# Story 6.3: Integrate Options Chain & Real-Time Options Data Feed

**As a** system (StockPulse platform, its AI agents, and options traders using the UI),
**I need** to integrate real-time options data, including full options chains, prices (bid/ask/last), volume, open interest, and Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho),
**So that** users can analyze options, AI agents can incorporate options data into their models (e.g., for volatility analysis, strategy generation), and options trading can be supported.

## Description
This story focuses on integrating comprehensive real-time data for exchange-traded options on equities. This involves connecting to a data provider that offers options chain lookups and streaming real-time updates for individual option contracts.

Key features include:
-   Identify and integrate with a data provider for real-time options data (e.g., Polygon.io, Cboe Live, a specialized options data vendor).
-   Ability to fetch the full options chain (all available strikes and expirations) for a given underlying equity symbol.
-   Stream real-time updates for individual option contracts: bid/ask prices, last sale, volume, open interest.
-   Ingest and make available key Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho) for each option contract, either directly from the feed or calculated (if necessary and feasible, though provider feed is preferred).
-   Normalize options data into a standard internal format.
-   Publish normalized real-time options data to an internal message bus/stream.
-   Store real-time options data (quotes, trades, Greeks) in `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`.
-   Store options contract details (strike, expiration, type, underlying, multiplier) in `StockPulse_PostgreSQL` or a suitable cache for quick lookup.
-   Robust error handling, connection management, and monitoring for the options data feed.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Options Data Provider Integration:** The system successfully connects to and authenticates with the chosen real-time options data provider.
2.  **AC2: Options Chain Retrieval:** The system can retrieve the complete, current options chain (all strikes, expirations, contract details) for a specified underlying equity symbol.
3.  **AC3: Real-Time Data Streaming:** The system receives real-time updates (bid/ask, last sale, volume, open interest) for subscribed/active option contracts.
4.  **AC4: Greeks Availability:** Real-time or frequently updated Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho) are available for each option contract.
5.  **AC5: Data Normalization & Storage:** Options data (chains, real-time updates, Greeks) is normalized and stored appropriately: contract details in PostgreSQL/cache, time-series data in `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`.
6.  **AC6: Internal Publication:** Normalized real-time options data is published to an internal message bus for consumption by other services.
7.  **AC7: Error Handling & Resilience:** The options data feed connection is resilient, with proper error handling and reconnection logic.
8.  **AC8: Data Accessibility:** Options data is accessible via the internal Data Access API Layer (Story 6.9).

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   Real-time options data feed and options chain lookup are operational.
-   Data including Greeks is flowing, normalized, published internally, and stored.
-   Connection management and basic monitoring are implemented.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and unit/integration tests passed.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) confirms options chains and real-time data are accurate for sample underlying symbols.

## AI Integration Details

-   Options data (especially implied volatility derived from Greeks) is critical for many AI financial models, risk assessment, and sophisticated trading strategy generation by AI agents.
-   AI can be used for anomaly detection in options pricing or Greek values (Story 6.8).

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Enables UI features for displaying options chains, individual contract details, and real-time options prices (handled in other epics/stories).

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 6: Data Sources & Market Integration](../epic-6.md)
-   `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB` and `StockPulse_PostgreSQL` (or cache) setup for options data.
-   Internal message bus/streaming infrastructure.
-   API key and subscription for the chosen options data provider.
-   Story 6.9 (Design & Implement Internal Data Access API Layer).
-   Story 6.1 (Real-Time Equity Feeds) as options are derived from underlying equities.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Selection of options data provider: Cost is a major factor for options data, as is coverage (e.g., all US equity options), quality of Greeks, and API reliability/latency.
-   Volume of data: Real-time data for all options contracts can be immense. Strategies for subscription management (e.g., only for actively viewed underlyings, or a core set of liquid options) may be needed.
-   Complexity of options data schemas and ensuring accurate mapping of Greeks.
-   Latency requirements for options traders can be very strict.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Timeliness:** Options data must be low-latency.
-   **Accuracy:** Prices, Greeks, and contract details must be highly accurate.
-   **Completeness:** Options chains should be complete for supported underlyings.
-   **Reliability:** Data feed must be very stable.
-   **Scalability:** System must handle data for a large number of optionable stocks and their contracts.
