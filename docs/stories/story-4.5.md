# Story 4.5: Develop AI Stock Screener Agent

**As an** investor (active trader or casual investor),
**I want** an AI Stock Screener Agent where I can define criteria (using forms or natural language like "find healthcare stocks with P/E below 15 and strong revenue growth") to discover stocks that match my specific investment strategy,
**So that** I can efficiently identify potential investment opportunities aligned with my goals, with the AI explaining its choices.

## Description
This story involves creating a dedicated AI-powered agent that allows users to screen for stocks based on a wide range of criteria. This goes beyond traditional screeners by incorporating natural language input and providing AI-generated explanations for the results.

Key features include:
-   A user interface for defining screening criteria:
    -   Traditional form-based input for common financial metrics (e.g., P/E, Market Cap, Dividend Yield, EPS Growth, Sector, Industry).
    -   A natural language input field where users can type queries (e.g., "show me undervalued tech stocks with high growth potential and low debt").
-   The AI Stock Screener Agent backend that can:
    -   Parse and interpret both form-based and natural language criteria.
    -   Query relevant data sources (`StockPulse_PostgreSQL` for fundamentals, `StockPulse_VectorDB` for qualitative/RAG-enhanced data like news sentiment or analyst ratings).
    -   Filter and rank stocks based on the defined criteria.
-   Display of screening results in a clear, sortable list or table format.
-   For each resulting stock, a brief AI-generated explanation of *why* it matched the screening criteria, highlighting key metrics or qualitative factors.
-   Ability to save screener criteria for later use (future enhancement, but consider in design).
-   Links from results to the Stock Detail Page (Story 4.2).

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: UI for Criteria Input:** A dedicated page or section exists for the AI Stock Screener, providing both form-based fields for common metrics and a natural language input field.
2.  **AC2: Form-Based Screening:** Users can define criteria using form fields (e.g., Sector = Technology, P/E < 20, Dividend Yield > 3%), and the agent returns a list of matching stocks.
3.  **AC3: Natural Language Screening (Basic):** The agent can interpret simple natural language queries involving common financial terms and concepts (e.g., "profitable biotech companies with recent positive news") and return relevant stocks.
4.  **AC4: Results Display:** Screening results are displayed in a clear, sortable list/table, showing key identifying information for each stock (Symbol, Name, Price) and the primary metrics used in the screen.
5.  **AC5: AI Explanation of Match:** For each stock in the results, a concise AI-generated explanation is provided, outlining why it met the screening criteria (e.g., "AAPL matched due to strong revenue growth of 15% and P/E of 25, aligning with your growth criteria").
6.  **AC6: Navigation to Detail Page:** Users can click on a stock in the results to navigate to its Stock Detail Page (Story 4.2).
7.  **AC7: No Results Handling:** If no stocks match the criteria, a clear message is displayed.
8.  **AC8: Performance:** Screener results are returned within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., < 5-10 seconds for typical queries, depending on complexity and data size).
9.  **AC9: Error Handling:** If the agent encounters an error during processing, a user-friendly message is displayed.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   AI Stock Screener Agent backend logic implemented, including parsing, querying, filtering, ranking, and explanation generation.
-   Frontend UI for criteria input and results display implemented.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and unit/integration tests passed.
-   AI models for NLP (for query interpretation) and generation (for explanations) are integrated.
-   Relevant data sources (`StockPulse_PostgreSQL`, `StockPulse_VectorDB`) are integrated.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) has reviewed and approved the functionality.
-   Screener is responsive and adheres to design guidelines.

## AI Integration Details

-   **Agent:** AI Stock Screener Agent (dedicated).
-   **Tasks:**
    -   Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to parse user queries into structured screening parameters.
    -   Querying structured databases (`StockPulse_PostgreSQL`) for financial metrics.
    -   Querying vector databases (`StockPulse_VectorDB`) for qualitative data (e.g., news sentiment, analyst opinions if criteria involve these).
    -   Applying filtering logic.
    -   Ranking results (optional, based on relevance or a composite score).
    -   Generating natural language explanations for why a stock matched.
-   **Models:** NLP/NLU models (e.g., for entity recognition, intent classification), LLMs for explanation generation.
-   **Data Sources:** `StockPulse_PostgreSQL` (fundamental data, pricing), `StockPulse_VectorDB` (news sentiment, analyst report summaries, other qualitative insights for RAG-enhanced screening).
-   **Flow:**
    1.  User inputs criteria (form or NL).
    2.  Frontend sends criteria to AI Stock Screener Agent backend.
    3.  Agent parses/interprets criteria.
    4.  Agent constructs and executes queries against relevant databases.
    5.  Agent filters, (optionally) ranks results.
    6.  For each result, Agent generates an explanation.
    7.  Agent returns structured results with explanations to frontend.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Intuitive interface for building complex screening criteria without being overwhelming.
-   Clear feedback to the user as they define criteria.
-   Easy-to-understand presentation of results and AI explanations.
-   Consideration for saving and managing user-defined screens in the future.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 4: Stock Discovery & Analysis](../epic-4.md)
-   Stock Detail Page (Story 4.2) for navigation from results.
-   Backend infrastructure for AI Agents.
-   Access to `StockPulse_PostgreSQL` and `StockPulse_VectorDB`.
-   Market data for current prices in results display.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Defining the initial scope of supported financial metrics and natural language query complexity.
-   Performance of complex queries across multiple data sources.
-   Accuracy and relevance of AI-generated explanations.
-   Potential for user confusion if AI interpretations of NL queries are not precise.
-   Balancing the power of the screener with ease of use.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Performance:** As per AC8.
-   **Accuracy:** Screener results should accurately reflect the defined criteria. AI explanations should be factual based on the data.
-   **Scalability:** The agent and database queries should scale to handle a large universe of stocks and numerous users.
