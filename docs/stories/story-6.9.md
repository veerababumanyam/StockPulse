# Story 6.9: Design & Implement Internal Data Access API Layer

**As a** system (internal services, AI agents, and frontend applications via a BFF),
**I need** a well-defined, consistent, and performant internal Data Access API layer,
**So that** various platform components can reliably and efficiently access the diverse datasets (market data, fundamentals, news, etc.) ingested and managed by Epic 6.

## Description
This story focuses on creating a unified API abstraction layer that sits on top of the various data stores (`StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`, `StockPulse_PostgreSQL`, `StockPulse_VectorDB`). This API will provide a clean interface for other services to query data without needing to know the underlying database-specific details.

Key features include:
-   Design the API endpoints, request/response schemas, and query parameters for accessing:
    *   Real-time market data (equities, options, FX, crypto).
    *   Historical market data (OHLCV for all asset classes at various granularities).
    *   Company fundamental data (financial statements, filings metadata, ratings).
    *   Financial news articles, sentiment scores, and associated metadata.
    *   (Future) Economic data.
-   Implement the API using a suitable technology stack (e.g., RESTful services with Python/FastAPI or Node.js/Express, or GraphQL).
-   Ensure the API provides filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities where appropriate.
-   Optimize API performance for common query patterns, potentially using caching strategies (e.g., Redis for frequently accessed data).
-   Implement proper authentication and authorization for API access (even if internal, good practice).
-   Provide clear API documentation for internal developer teams and AI agent developers.
-   Version the API to allow for future evolution without breaking existing consumers.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: API Design Finalized:** The design for the Data Access API (endpoints, schemas, query params) covering all key data types from Epic 6 is documented and approved.
2.  **AC2: API Implementation for Key Data:** Core API endpoints for accessing real-time market data, historical OHLCV, company fundamentals (statements), and news articles are implemented and functional.
3.  **AC3: Query Capabilities:** Implemented API endpoints support necessary filtering (e.g., by symbol, date range, data type), sorting, and pagination.
4.  **AC4: Performance:** API response times for common queries meet defined performance targets (e.g., p95 latency for historical data queries).
5.  **AC5: Security:** Basic authentication/authorization mechanisms are in place for API access.
6.  **AC6: Documentation:** API endpoints are documented (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI for REST, or GraphQL schema documentation) for internal consumers.
7.  **AC7: Test Coverage:** The API has adequate unit and integration test coverage.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   The internal Data Access API Layer is designed, implemented, and operational for key data types.
-   API is performant, secure (basic), and well-documented.
-   Other internal teams can successfully query data through the API.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and tests passed.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) and technical leads confirm the API meets the access needs for platform development.

## AI Integration Details

-   **Critical Enabler for AI:** This API will be the primary way AI agents access the vast majority of data they need for analysis, model training, and insight generation.
-   A well-designed API simplifies AI agent development by abstracting away data storage complexities.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Not directly a UI story, but this API will be consumed by Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) services that power UI components displaying data.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 6: Data Sources & Market Integration](../epic-6.md)
-   Completed data ingestion stories (6.1-6.6, 6.10 when done) as this API provides access to that data.
-   Underlying databases (`StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`, `StockPulse_PostgreSQL`, `StockPulse_VectorDB`) being populated with data.
-   Defined internal data schemas for all data types.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Choice of API technology (REST vs. GraphQL) and framework.
-   Defining a consistent and intuitive query language/parameter set across diverse data types.
-   Performance optimization for complex queries or very large datasets.
-   Caching strategy and cache invalidation logic.
-   Versioning strategy for the API.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Performance:** API must be low-latency for most queries.
-   **Reliability:** API must be highly available.
-   **Scalability:** API layer should scale to handle a large number of internal requests.
-   **Maintainability:** API code should be well-structured and maintainable.
-   **Usability (for developers):** API should be easy for internal teams to understand and use.
