# Story 5.5: Implement Trade Execution History View with AI Post-Trade Analysis

**As a** user (active trader, investor, or for record-keeping purposes),
**I want** to see a historical list of my fully or partially filled orders (trade executions), showing all relevant details, and optionally, an AI-generated summary of each trade's impact, outcome, and alignment with initial AI pre-trade insights (if applicable),
**So that** I can track my historical trading activity, verify executions, understand the performance of my trades with AI context, and for record-keeping.

## Description
This story focuses on providing a comprehensive view of all executed trades (fills). Beyond standard trade details, it introduces an AI-powered post-trade analysis for each execution, offering users insights into how the trade performed relative to its objectives or initial AI advisories.

Key features include:
-   Display of all executed trades/fills in reverse chronological order.
-   Standard trade details: Execution Date/Time, Symbol, Action, Filled Quantity, Execution Price(s), Fees/Commissions, Net Amount, Order ID.
-   **AI Post-Trade Analysis Section (per trade):**
    -   Brief AI summary of the trade's immediate impact on the portfolio (e.g., change in cash, position size).
    -   If the order was placed with AI pre-trade insights (Story 5.1) or AI-suggested parameters (Story 5.2), the post-trade analysis can reference these: e.g., "Limit order filled at your target price, which was suggested by AI based on volatility."
    -   AI comment on whether the trade achieved its implied short-term outcome (e.g., for a limit order, was it filled at a favorable price compared to market movement shortly after? For a stop order, did it successfully limit a loss as intended?).
-   Filtering options: Date Range, Symbol, Action (Buy/Sell).
-   Pagination for large trade histories.
-   Loading states, error handling, and an empty state message.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Comprehensive Trade Details:** The history view lists executed trades with: Execution Date/Time, Symbol, Action, Filled Quantity, Execution Price, Fees/Commissions (if available), and Net Amount.
2.  **AC2: AI Post-Trade Analysis Display:** For each trade, an optional (expandable?) section displays an AI-generated post-trade analysis, including impact on portfolio and outcome assessment, referencing prior AI insights if applicable.
3.  **AC3: Clarity of AI Analysis:** AI analysis is clearly attributed, concise, and provides understandable insights without being overly prescriptive about long-term success (focus is on immediate execution context).
4.  **AC4: Filtering Functionality:** Users can filter the trade history by Date Range, Symbol, and Action (Buy/Sell).
5.  **AC5: Pagination:** Pagination is implemented and functional for navigating large trade histories.
6.  **AC6: Data Accuracy:** All displayed trade data and AI-derived insights are accurate based on available information.
7.  **AC7: Loading/Empty/Error States:** Appropriate loading, empty state (no trades), and error handling messages are displayed.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   UI for displaying trade history and AI post-trade analysis is implemented.
-   Integration with AI Trade Advisor Agent (or relevant service) for generating post-trade analysis is functional.
-   Backend API for fetching trade/fill history is integrated.
-   Filtering and pagination are fully functional.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and unit/integration tests passed.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) has reviewed and approved the functionality, including the AI post-trade analysis feature.

## AI Integration Details

-   **Agent:** AI Trade Advisor Agent.
-   **Task:** Provide post-trade analysis for executed trades.
-   **Models:** LLM for generating textual summaries and analysis.
-   **Data Sources for AI Analysis:**
    -   `StockPulse_PostgreSQL`: Executed trade details (price, quantity, time), original order details (including any AI pre-trade insights or suggested parameters saved with the order), user portfolio data.
    -   `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`: Market data around the time of execution (e.g., to assess if a limit order filled favorably).
    -   `StockPulse_VectorDB`: Potentially, to reference general trading principles or educational content in explanations.
-   **Flow for AI Post-Trade Analysis:**
    1.  Trade execution data is available for a specific trade ID / order ID.
    2.  When displaying trade history, frontend requests AI post-trade analysis for visible trades (or it's pre-fetched with trade data).
    3.  Backend service calls AI Trade Advisor Agent with trade details and original order context (if available, including prior AI insights).
    4.  Agent analyzes the execution against its context (e.g., market conditions at the time, original AI advice, type of order) and generates an analytical summary.
    5.  Agent returns the summary to the backend, which then passes it to the frontend.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Clear, tabular display for trade data.
-   AI Post-Trade Analysis could be in an expandable section per trade to avoid cluttering the main view.
-   Visual cues to link post-trade analysis back to any pre-trade AI insights if applicable.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 5: Trading & Order Management](../epic-5.md)
-   Backend API for fetching detailed trade execution history (fills), including fees/commissions.
-   AI Trade Advisor Agent (backend logic - Story 5.7) capable of generating post-trade analysis.
-   Mechanism to store or access the original AI pre-trade insights/suggestions associated with an order, if they are to be referenced in post-trade analysis.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Defining the scope and depth of AI post-trade analysis (e.g., how sophisticated should the outcome assessment be?).
-   Availability and granularity of data needed for meaningful post-trade analysis (e.g., precise timestamps, market data at execution).
-   Potential for AI analysis to seem obvious or unhelpful if not carefully designed.
-   Managing user expectations: AI post-trade analysis is not a predictor of future success but a review of a past event.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Performance:** Trade history, including AI analysis, should load efficiently.
-   **Accuracy:** All displayed data, including AI interpretations, must be factually accurate.
-   **Scalability:** System should handle large volumes of trade history.
