# Story 13.5: Continuous Ethical Monitoring & Audit Trails for AGI

**Epic:** Epic 13: AGI Safety & Ethics
**Story ID:** 13.5
**Story Title:** Continuous Ethical Monitoring & Audit Trails for AGI
**Assigned to:** Ethics Committee, Development Team  
**Story Points:** 10

## Business Context
As a StockPulse platform operator, I need a system for continuous ethical monitoring of AGI actions and comprehensive audit trails to ensure ongoing adherence to our defined ethical principles (Story 13.1), detect and rectify ethical breaches promptly, and provide transparency and accountability for AGI decision-making processes. ([Source: User stories with examples and a template, Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories))

## User Story
**As an** ethics committee member  
**I want to** have continuous ethical monitoring and detailed audit trails for all AGI systems  
**So that** I can ensure AGI behavior consistently aligns with our ethical guidelines, identify and investigate potential ethical violations, and maintain a transparent record of AGI decisions for accountability and continuous improvement.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Real-Time Ethical Performance Dashboard

- Visualization of AGI decisions and their ethical implications.
- Alerting system for deviations from ethical benchmarks or potential ethical breaches.
- Customizable views for different stakeholders (ethics committee, developers, auditors).
- Integration with the Ethical Decision-Making Framework (Story 13.3) outputs.
- Reporting on the operationalization of defined Ethical Principles (Story 13.1).

### 2. Comprehensive AGI Audit Trail Logging
- Immutable and tamper-proof logging of all significant AGI actions, decisions, and data inputs.
- Detailed records of the reasoning process or models used for each AGI decision (explainability links).
- Logging of any human interventions, overrides, or feedback provided to AGI systems.
- Secure storage and access control for audit trail data.
- Sufficient granularity in logs to reconstruct AGI decision pathways and identify contributing factors.
- Correlation of AGI actions with market impacts and user outcomes for ethical assessment.

### 3. Automated Ethical Compliance Checks

- Workflow for managing ethical incident cases from detection to resolution and remediation.
- Standardized reporting templates for ethical incident investigations and outcomes.
- Root cause analysis capabilities to understand why an ethical breach occurred.
- Tracking of remediation actions and their effectiveness.

### 5. Periodic Ethical Audits & Reviews
- Framework for conducting periodic, in-depth ethical audits of AGI systems.
- Checklists and methodologies for comprehensive ethical reviews, covering data, algorithms, and operational impact.
- Involvement of independent ethical auditors or reviewers where appropriate.
- Assessment of the long-term ethical implications of AGI deployment and learning.
- Review of the effectiveness of the continuous monitoring system itself.
- Publication of summary ethical audit reports (with appropriate redactions for sensitivity).

### 6. Feedback Loop for Ethical Improvement
- Mechanisms for incorporating findings from monitoring, audits, and incident investigations back into AGI design and ethical guidelines.
- Process for updating ethical constraints and training data based on identified issues.
- Tracking of changes made to AGI systems or policies in response to ethical reviews.

  agiAgentId: string;
  ethicalPrincipleViolated: string; // e.g., 'Fairness', 'Transparency'
  description: string;
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  status: 'new' | 'investigating' | 'resolved';
}

interface AuditTrailQueryInterface {
  agentIdFilter: string;

```

### AI Integration Components
- AI-powered ethical metric calculation engines.
- NLP for analyzing AGI communication logs for ethical language.
- Anomaly detection models for identifying unethical AGI behavior patterns.
- AI tools for assisting in bias detection and mitigation in models and data.
- AI-assisted root cause analysis for ethical incidents.
