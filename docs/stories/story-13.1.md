# Story 13.1: Implement Explainable AI (XAI) Engine

**Epic:** 13 - AGI Safety & Ethics Framework

**User Story:** As a user, I need clear, understandable explanations for every AI recommendation and decision so I can trust and verify the reasoning behind AI suggestions for my financial decisions.

**Status:** To Do

## Business Context:
This story implements the foundation for trustworthy AI by making all AI decisions transparent and explainable. This is critical for regulatory compliance, user trust, and safe AGI development, ensuring users can understand and verify AI reasoning in high-stakes financial decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Multi-Level Explanation System:**
   - **Simple Explanations:** Plain language summaries for general users
   - **Detailed Explanations:** Step-by-step reasoning for experienced users
   - **Technical Explanations:** Algorithm details and confidence metrics for developers
   - **Visual Explanations:** Charts, diagrams, and interactive visualizations of decision logic

2. **Decision Transparency Framework:**
   - Real-time explanation generation for all AI agent recommendations
   - Explanation consistency across different agents and decision types
   - Historical explanation tracking allowing users to review past reasoning
   - Explanation versioning when AI models or logic are updated

3. **Counterfactual and Alternative Analysis:**
   - "What if" scenarios showing how different inputs would change recommendations
   - Alternative recommendations with explanations of why they weren't chosen
   - Sensitivity analysis showing which factors most influence decisions
   - Confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification for all predictions

4. **Feature Importance and Attribution:**
   - Clear identification of which data points influenced each decision
   - Relative importance scoring for different factors in the decision process
   - Data source attribution linking recommendations to specific market data
   - Time-based attribution showing how recent vs. historical data impacts decisions

5. **Reasoning Chain Visualization:**
   - Step-by-step logical progression from data inputs to final recommendations
   - Decision tree or flow chart representations of complex reasoning
   - Symbolic reasoning integration showing logical inference steps
   - Natural language generation converting technical processes to readable explanations

6. **User-Customizable Explanation Preferences:**
   - Explanation depth and technical level customization per user
   - Focus area preferences (risk-focused, return-focused, process-focused explanations)
   - Explanation format preferences (text, visual, interactive)
   - Frequency settings for explanation delivery (always, on-demand, for major decisions)

## Technical Guidance:

### Backend Architecture:
- **Framework:** Node.js/TypeScript with Python ML services for explanation generation
- **XAI Libraries:** LIME, SHAP, IntegratedGradients, or custom explanation engines
- **NLG Integration:** Natural Language Generation for converting technical explanations to readable text
- **Visualization APIs:** D3.js and Chart.js integration for explanation visualizations

### API Endpoints:
- `GET /api/xai/explain/{decision}` - Get explanation for a specific decision
- `POST /api/xai/what-if` - Generate counterfactual explanations
- `GET /api/xai/features/{decision}` - Get feature importance for a decision
- `POST /api/xai/preferences` - Update user explanation preferences
- `GET /api/xai/reasoning-chain/{decision}` - Get step-by-step reasoning visualization

### XAI Data Models:
```typescript
interface AIExplanation {
  explanationId: string;
  decisionId: string;
  agentId: string;
  userId: string;
  explanationLevel: 'simple' | 'detailed' | 'technical';
  summary: string;
  reasoningSteps: ReasoningStep[];
  featureImportance: FeatureImportance[];
  alternatives: AlternativeExplanation[];
  confidence: number;
  uncertainty: UncertaintyMetrics;
  timestamp: Date;
}

interface ReasoningStep {
  stepNumber: number;
  description: string;
  inputData: any;
  process: string;
  output: any;
  confidence: number;
  reasoning: string;
}

interface FeatureImportance {
  feature: string;
  importance: number;
  direction: 'positive' | 'negative';
  dataSource: string;
  description: string;
}

interface CounterfactualScenario {
  scenarioId: string;
  changes: FeatureChange[];
  newRecommendation: any;
  explanation: string;
  probability: number;
}
```

### Integration with AI Agents:
- All agents must implement explanation interfaces for their decisions
- Symbolic Reasoning Engine (Story 11.1) provides logical explanation components
- Cognitive Memory Architecture (Story 11.2) provides historical context for explanations
- **Agent Design:** The XAI capabilities and the way explanations are generated and presented must align with the transparency, explainability, and user trust principles in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`.
