  - Risk threshold breaches and opportunity detection alerts
  - Market anomaly and pattern change notifications
  - Portfolio performance and position alerts

- [ ] **Smart Alert Prioritization**
  - Dynamic alert scoring based on urgency and impact
  - User preference learning and personalized alert filtering
  - Alert deduplication and correlation analysis
  - Escalation protocols for critical alerts

### Multi-Channel Alert Delivery

- [ ] **Flexible Delivery Options**

  - In-app notifications with rich context
  - Email alerts with detailed analysis
  - SMS/Push notifications for urgent alerts
  - Voice alerts through AG-UI system

- [ ] **Contextual Alert Intelligence**
  - Rich alert context with relevant charts and data
  - Recommended actions and next steps
  - Historical alert performance tracking
  - Alert feedback loop for continuous improvement

### AG-UI Alert Integration

- [ ] **Voice-Activated Alert Management**
  - Voice commands for alert configuration and management
  - Spoken alert summaries and briefings
  - Natural language alert queries and responses

## Technical Specifications

```typescript
interface AlertSystem {
  monitor: AlertMonitoringEngine;
  processor: AlertProcessingEngine;
  delivery: AlertDeliveryEngine;
  manager: AlertManagementEngine;
}

interface Alert {
  id: string;
  source: string; // Agent that generated the alert
  type: AlertType;
  priority: AlertPriority;
  message: string;
  context: AlertContext;
  actionable: boolean;
  expiresAt?: Date;
}
```

```python
class AlertMonitoringEngine:
    async def monitor_agent_outputs(self):
        """Monitor all agent outputs for alert conditions"""
        for agent in self.active_agents:
            outputs = await agent.get_latest_outputs()
            alerts = self.evaluate_alert_conditions(outputs)
            if alerts:
                await self.process_alerts(alerts)
```

### Performance Requirements

- **Alert Generation**: <5 seconds from condition detection to alert generation
- **Alert Delivery**: <10 seconds for in-app notifications, <30 seconds for email/SMS
- **Alert Processing**: <1000 concurrent alerts processing capability
- **Voice Alerts**: <3 seconds for voice alert delivery

## Business Value

- **Risk Management**: Proactive risk monitoring and alert generation
- **Opportunity Capture**: Real-time opportunity detection and notification
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated monitoring reduces manual oversight
- **User Experience**: Personalized, intelligent alert management

## Success Metrics

- Alert accuracy >90% for actionable alerts
- Response time <5 seconds for critical alert generation
- User engagement >85% with personalized alert preferences
- False positive rate <10% for high-priority alerts ðŸš€
