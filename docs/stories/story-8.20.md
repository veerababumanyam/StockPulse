# Story 8.20: Implement FOMC Event Intelligence Agent

**Epic:** [Epic 8: Enhanced AI Agents & Intelligence](../epic-8.md)

**Status:** To Do

**Priority:** High

**Estimated Effort:** 16 Story Points (4 weeks)

## User Story

**As a** institutional trader or portfolio manager
**I want** an AI agent that monitors FOMC events and adapts forecasting models based on Federal Reserve communications and market reactions
**So that** I can anticipate interest rate impacts, adjust risk models during monetary policy changes, and make informed decisions around central bank events

## Description

Implement a specialized AI agent that focuses on Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) events, monitoring central bank communications, analyzing market reactions, and dynamically adjusting forecasting models during monetary policy announcements. This agent uses Bayesian updating to incorporate FOMC-specific information and provides real-time insights on interest rate sensitivity and market regime changes.

The agent integrates with the AG-UI framework to provide contextual interfaces during FOMC events, leveraging natural language processing for Fed communications analysis and voice-activated FOMC briefings.
