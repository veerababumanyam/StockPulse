# Story 15.6: Develop Goal Decomposition and Distribution Engine

**Epic:** 15 - AGI Orchestration & Multi-Agent Coordination

**User Story:** As a user, I want to provide high-level goals and have the AGI system automatically break them down into actionable tasks and coordinate multiple agents to achieve them.

**Status:** To Do

## Business Context:
This story implements a sophisticated goal decomposition and distribution engine that takes high-level user objectives and automatically breaks them down into actionable tasks, then intelligently distributes these tasks across multiple AI agents for coordinated execution. This capability enables users to interact with the AGI system at a strategic level while the system handles tactical execution through agent orchestration.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Intelligent Goal Analysis:**
   - Natural language processing to understand complex, multi-faceted user goals
   - Goal classification and categorization for appropriate decomposition strategies
   - Context analysis incorporating user history, preferences, and current market conditions
   - Ambiguity resolution through clarifying questions or intelligent assumptions

2. **Hierarchical Task Decomposition:**
   - Automatic breakdown of complex goals into hierarchical task structures
   - Task dependency analysis ensuring proper sequencing and prerequisite management
   - Parallel task identification for concurrent execution and time optimization
   - Risk assessment and contingency planning for critical task dependencies

3. **Optimal Agent Assignment:**
   - Intelligent matching of decomposed tasks to agents with appropriate capabilities
   - Load balancing across available agents to optimize resource utilization
   - Capability gap identification when tasks require specialized expertise not currently available
   - Dynamic reassignment capabilities when agent availability or performance changes

4. **Coordination and Execution Management:**
   - Master coordination plan ensuring all sub-tasks align toward the overall goal
   - Progress monitoring and milestone tracking for complex, multi-stage objectives
   - Adaptive execution adjusting plans based on intermediate results and changing conditions
   - Quality assurance ensuring task completion meets required standards

5. **Inter-Task Communication and Synchronization:**
   - Communication protocols enabling agents working on related tasks to coordinate effectively
   - Data sharing mechanisms ensuring agents have access to relevant information from other tasks
   - Synchronization points where multiple tasks must coordinate before proceeding
   - Conflict resolution when tasks have competing resource requirements or conflicting approaches

6. **Goal Achievement Validation:**
   - Success criteria definition and measurement for each decomposed task and overall goal
   - Validation mechanisms ensuring completed tasks contribute to the original objective
   - User satisfaction verification confirming the achieved outcome meets expectations
   - Learning from goal achievement outcomes to improve future decomposition strategies

## Technical Guidance:

### Backend Architecture:
- **Framework:** Python with workflow orchestration libraries (Apache Airflow, Temporal) and NLP processing
- **AI/ML:** Large language models for goal understanding and task generation algorithms
- **Orchestration:** Distributed task management and workflow coordination systems
- **Analytics:** Performance tracking and optimization engines for goal achievement metrics

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/goal-engine/decompose` - Break down high-level goals into actionable tasks
- `POST /api/goal-engine/distribute` - Assign decomposed tasks to appropriate agents
- `GET /api/goal-engine/progress` - Monitor progress toward goal achievement
- `POST /api/goal-engine/adapt` - Adjust task distribution based on changing conditions
- `GET /api/goal-engine/validate` - Validate goal achievement and measure success

### Data Models:
```typescript
interface UserGoal {
  goalId: string;
  userId: string;
  description: string;
  goalType: 'financial' | 'investment' | 'risk_management' | 'analysis' | 'complex';
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  timeframe: TimeConstraint;
  successCriteria: SuccessCriterion[];
  context: GoalContext;
  status: 'analyzing' | 'decomposing' | 'executing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
}

interface TaskDecomposition {
  decompositionId: string;
  parentGoalId: string;
  tasks: DecomposedTask[];
  dependencies: TaskDependency[];
  coordinationPlan: CoordinationPlan;
  estimatedTimeline: number;
  resourceRequirements: ResourceRequirement[];
  riskAssessment: RiskAssessment;
}

interface DecomposedTask {
  taskId: string;
  description: string;
  requiredCapabilities: string[];
  assignedAgent: AgentId;
  dependencies: string[];
  priority: number;
  estimatedDuration: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'assigned' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  deliverables: Deliverable[];
}
```

### Integration with Existing Systems:
- Utilizes Dynamic Agent Team Composition (Story 15.4) for optimal agent assignment
- Integrates with Advanced A2A Coordination (Story 15.1) for task coordination
- Leverages Self-Organizing Agent Networks (Story 15.5) for adaptive execution
- **Agent Design:** Agents must be designed to accept, understand, and execute decomposed tasks, report progress, and collaborate as part of a larger goal, adhering to the principles in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`.
