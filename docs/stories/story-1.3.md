# Story 1.3: Implement Basic Session Management & Logout

**Epic:** [Core User Authentication and Account Setup](../epic-1.md)
**Status:** Draft
**Priority:** High
**Points:** (Estimate)
**Assigned To:**
**Sprint:**

## 1. User Story

> As an authenticated user,
> I want the application to manage my session effectively so I don't have to log in repeatedly during active use, and I want to be able to log out securely when I choose,
> So that my account remains secure and my user experience is convenient.

## 2. Requirements

*   Upon successful login (Story 1.2), the user's session should be established and maintained across browser tabs and page navigations within the application.
*   The frontend should securely store and manage session identifiers (e.g., JWT token) provided by the backend.
*   Provide a clear and accessible logout mechanism (e.g., a "Logout" button in the user profile menu or main navigation header).
*   Clicking "Logout" should:
    *   Clear any client-side session information (tokens, user data in state).
    *   Optionally, notify the backend API to invalidate the session/token on the server-side, if applicable to the auth strategy.
    *   Redirect the user to the login page or homepage.
*   The application should handle session expiry gracefully:
    *   If a token expires and an API call fails due to an authentication error (e.g., 401 Unauthorized), the user should be automatically logged out and redirected to the login page with an appropriate message (e.g., "Your session has expired. Please log in again.").
*   An `AuthContext` or similar mechanism should provide authentication status (e.g., `isAuthenticated`, `user` object) to all relevant parts of the application.
*   Protect routes that require authentication, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  **AC1:** Given a user has successfully logged in, when they navigate to different pages or refresh the application, they remain logged in and can access protected routes.
2.  **AC2:** Given an authenticated user clicks the "Logout" button, then their client-side session is cleared, they are redirected to the login page, and they can no longer access protected routes without logging in again.
3.  **AC3:** Given an authenticated user's session/token expires, when they attempt to access a protected resource or make an API call requiring authentication, then they are automatically logged out and redirected to the login page with a session expiry message.
4.  **AC4:** Given a user is not authenticated, when they attempt to access a protected route (e.g., `/dashboard`), then they are redirected to the `/login` page.
5.  **AC5:** The `AuthContext` accurately reflects the user's authentication state (e.g., `isAuthenticated` is true after login, false after logout or session expiry) and provides user information if logged in.
6.  **AC6:** (If backend invalidation is implemented) Given an authenticated user clicks the "Logout" button, then a request is made to the backend to invalidate the current session/token.

## 4. Technical Guidance for Developer Agent

*   **Relevant PRD Sections:**
    *   `PRD.md#4.3` (Security Requirements)
*   **Relevant Architecture Sections:**
    *   `architecture.md#3.1.2` (State Management, Auth Context)
    *   `architecture.md#5.1` (Authentication & Authorization - JWT session handling)
*   **Key Components/Modules to be affected/created:**
    *   Context: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (critical for managing auth state, user data, login/logout functions).
    *   Service: `src/services/authService.ts` (for logout API call if any, and managing token storage).
    *   Components: A `LogoutButton.tsx` component, likely part of `src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx` or a user menu.
    *   Routing: Implementation of protected routes using a wrapper component (e.g., `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`).
    *   API Interceptor: An Axios or Fetch interceptor to handle 401 errors globally for session expiry.
*   **API Endpoints Involved:**
    *   `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` (Optional, if backend invalidates tokens. Backend to confirm).
        *   Expected Request: May carry the token to invalidate.
        *   Expected Response (200/204): Success.
*   **Styling/UI Notes:**
    *   Logout button should be clearly visible in a standard location (e.g., user dropdown in header).
    *   Session expiry messages should be user-friendly notifications or alerts.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   Ensure secure deletion of tokens from client-side storage on logout.
    *   If using JWTs, consider their expiry time and refresh token strategy (though refresh tokens might be a separate, more advanced story).

## 5. Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **Task 1 (AC5):** Enhance/Implement `AuthContext.tsx` to store user authentication status, user data, and token.
    *   Provide functions for login (sets state) and logout (clears state).
2.  **Task 2 (AC1, AC4):** Implement `ProtectedRoute.tsx` component to guard routes requiring authentication.
    *   Redirects to `/login` if user is not authenticated (based on `AuthContext`).
3.  **Task 3 (AC1):** Apply `ProtectedRoute` to relevant application routes (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/portfolio`).
4.  **Task 4 (AC2, AC6):** Create `LogoutButton.tsx` component.
    *   On click, call logout function from `AuthContext` (which clears client session and calls `authService.logout` if backend invalidation is used).
    *   Redirect to `/login`.
5.  **Task 5 (AC3):** Implement an API request interceptor (e.g., for Axios or Fetch) to detect 401 errors.
    *   On 401, trigger logout action in `AuthContext` and redirect to login with a session expiry message.
6.  **Task 6 (AC2):** Ensure client-side token/session information is properly cleared on logout from `authService.ts` or `AuthContext`.
7.  **Task 7 (N/A):** Write unit tests for `AuthContext`, `ProtectedRoute`, and logout functionality.

## 6. Definition of Done (DoD)

*   All Acceptance Criteria (AC1-AC6) met.
*   User session persists across navigation and refreshes.
*   Logout functionality works correctly, clearing session and redirecting.
*   Session expiry is handled gracefully, redirecting to login.
*   Protected routes are inaccessible to unauthenticated users.
*   `AuthContext` correctly reflects authentication state.
*   Code reviewed, merged, unit tests passing.

## 7. Notes / Questions

*   Confirm backend strategy for token invalidation on logout. If not implemented, AC6 can be deferred/removed.
*   Decide on the exact user experience for session expiry (e.g., toast notification + redirect vs. silent redirect).
*   JWT token refresh strategy is out of scope for this story but should be considered for long-term session management.

## 8. Design / UI Mockup Links (If Applicable)

*   Refer to `docs/StockPulse_Design.md` for header/navigation layout where logout button might reside.
