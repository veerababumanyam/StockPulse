## Technical Specifications

```typescript
interface MLOpsSystem {
  trainingPipeline: ModelTrainingPipeline;
  deploymentEngine: ModelDeploymentEngine;
  monitoringSystem: ModelMonitoringSystem;
  optimizationEngine: ModelOptimizationEngine;
}

interface ModelMetadata {
  modelId: string;
  version: string;
  architecture: string;
  performance: ModelPerformance;
  deploymentStatus: DeploymentStatus;
  monitoringMetrics: MonitoringMetrics;
}
```

```python
class MLOpsManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.training_pipeline = ModelTrainingPipeline()
        self.deployment_engine = ModelDeploymentEngine()
        self.monitoring_system = ModelMonitoringSystem()

    async def manage_model_lifecycle(self, model_config: ModelConfiguration) -> ModelMetadata:
        """Manage complete model lifecycle"""

        # Train model with latest data
        trained_model = await self.training_pipeline.train_model(model_config)

        # Validate model performance
        validation_results = await self.validate_model(trained_model)

        # Deploy if validation passes
        if validation_results.is_valid:
            deployment = await self.deployment_engine.deploy_model(trained_model)

            # Start monitoring
            await self.monitoring_system.start_monitoring(deployment)

        return ModelMetadata(
            modelId=trained_model.id,
            version=trained_model.version,
            performance=validation_results.performance,
            deploymentStatus=deployment.status
        )
```

### Performance Requirements

- **Model Training**: <2 hours for complex model training with large datasets
- **Model Deployment**: <10 minutes for model deployment and activation
- **Monitoring Latency**: <30 seconds for drift detection and alerting
