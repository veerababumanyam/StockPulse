# Story 8.30: Implement Corporate Event Intelligence and M&A Analysis Agent

**Epic:** [Epic 8: Enhanced AI Agents & Intelligence](../epic-8.md)

**Status:** To Do

**Priority:** High

**Estimated Effort:** 22 Story Points (5.5 weeks)

## User Story

**As a** merger arbitrageur, corporate analyst, or event-driven fund manager
**I want** comprehensive monitoring and analysis of all corporate events including M&A announcements, guidance revisions, dividend policy changes, and special situations
**So that** I can capitalize on event-driven opportunities, assess corporate strategic changes early, predict market reactions, and manage event-driven portfolio strategies with institutional-level intelligence

## Description

Implement a sophisticated corporate event intelligence agent that goes beyond standard earnings analysis to monitor and analyze mergers & acquisitions, management guidance revisions, dividend announcements, stock splits, spin-offs, activist campaigns, and other corporate events. This agent uses advanced NLP, sentiment analysis, deal probability modeling, and cross-company correlation analysis to provide comprehensive corporate event intelligence.

The agent integrates with regulatory filings, news sources, social media, and alternative data to detect corporate events early and assess their market impact with institutional-level sophistication.
