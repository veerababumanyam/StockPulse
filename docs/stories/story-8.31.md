# Story 8.31: Implement Market Anomaly Detection and Flash Crash Prevention Agent

**Epic:** [Epic 8: Enhanced AI Agents & Intelligence](../epic-8.md)

**Status:** To Do

**Priority:** Critical

**Estimated Effort:** 21 Story Points (5.25 weeks)

## User Story

**As a** risk manager, systematic trader, or market surveillance officer
**I want** real-time detection of market anomalies, flash crash conditions, and unusual market behavior patterns
**So that** I can protect portfolios from extreme market events, capitalize on temporary dislocations, ensure market integrity, and respond rapidly to geopolitical shocks and systemic risks

## Description

Implement an advanced market anomaly detection and flash crash prevention agent that monitors for unusual market behavior, algorithm-triggered crashes, geopolitical developments, supply chain disruptions, and end-of-period effects. This agent uses ultra-high frequency data analysis, machine learning anomaly detection, geopolitical sentiment monitoring, and real-time risk assessment to provide comprehensive market surveillance and protection.

The agent integrates with order book intelligence, alternative data sources, and news feeds to detect and prevent extreme market events while identifying opportunities from temporary market dislocations.

```typescript
interface AnomalyDetectionVoiceCommands {
  queries: {
    "What unusual market activity is detected right now?": () => Promise<string>;
    "Show me current flash crash risk levels": () => Promise<void>;
    "Are there any geopolitical events affecting markets?": () => Promise<string>;
    "What's causing the volatility spike in tech stocks?": () => Promise<string>;
    "Activate emergency risk reduction protocols": () => Promise<void>;
  };

  riskManagement: {
    assessFlashCrashRisk: () => Promise<void>;
    activateEmergencyHedging: () => Promise<void>;
    monitorGeopoliticalRisks: () => Promise<void>;
  };
