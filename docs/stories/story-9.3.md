# Story 9.3: Analyst Reports Processing & Knowledge Integration Pipeline

**Epic:** Epic 9: Data Analytics & Business Intelligence - Backend AI Data Pipelines & KB Management
**Story ID:** 9.3
**Story Title:** Analyst Reports Processing & Knowledge Integration Pipeline
**Assigned to:** Data Engineering Team, AI Research Team
**Story Points:** 12

## Business Context

As a StockPulse AGI system, I need access to the rich insights and structured data often found within financial analyst reports (e.g., earnings estimates, price targets, buy/sell/hold ratings, qualitative assessments). To achieve this, as a data engineer, I need to build a robust pipeline to ingest, parse, extract key information from, and integrate analyst reports into our AGI Knowledge Graph and semantic memory. ([Source: User stories with examples and a template, Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories))

## User Story

**As a** data engineer
**I want to** develop a pipeline to process financial analyst reports and integrate their key data and insights into the AGI Knowledge Graph
**So that** AGI agents can leverage this valuable, often structured, information for improved market analysis, stock valuation, and prediction tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Secure Ingestion of Analyst Reports

- Secure and reliable ingestion of analyst reports from various sources (e.g., third-party data providers like Refinitiv/Bloomberg, direct feeds, web scraping where permissible).
- Support for various file formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, structured data feeds if available).
- Automated retrieval and versioning of reports.
- Pre-processing of reports, including OCR for image-based PDFs if necessary.
- Metadata extraction (e.g., analyst firm, analyst name, publication date, covered company/ticker).
- Compliance with licensing agreements and terms of service for report providers.

### 2. Advanced Information Extraction from Reports

- NLP techniques to parse the textual content of reports (summaries, industry outlooks, company analysis).
- Extraction of structured data points: earnings estimates (EPS), revenue forecasts, price targets, ratings (buy/sell/hold), valuation methodologies.
- Identification and extraction of key arguments, rationales, and supporting evidence for analyst recommendations.
- Sentiment analysis on different sections of the report or specific statements.
- Extraction of comparable company analysis (comps) tables and data.
- Handling of tables, charts, and other non-textual elements within reports to extract data.

### 3. Knowledge Graph Integration & Semantic Linking

- Mapping of extracted information (entities, estimates, ratings, sentiment) to the AGI Knowledge Graph ontology (Story 14.1).
- Creation/update of nodes for analysts, research firms, and specific report findings.
- Linking analyst opinions and estimates to company nodes, industry nodes, and relevant market events in the KG.
- Timestamping of all extracted data to reflect its publication date and relevance over time.
- Confidence scoring for extracted information based on source reliability or extraction method accuracy.
- Reconciliation of conflicting information from different analyst reports (e.g., differing price targets).

### 4. Pipeline Automation & Scalability

- Fully automated pipeline from report ingestion to KG integration.
- Scalable architecture to handle a large volume of reports from numerous sources.
- Robust error handling, logging, and alerting for pipeline failures.
- Scheduling of pipeline runs (e.g., daily, or event-triggered upon new report availability).
- Monitoring of pipeline performance, data quality, and KG update success rates.
- Backfilling capabilities to process historical analyst reports.

### 5. Data Quality Assurance & Validation

- Automated validation checks for extracted data (e.g., data type consistency, range checks for financial figures).
- Human-in-the-loop interface for reviewing and correcting low-confidence extractions or resolving ambiguities.
- Comparison of extracted data against other sources for cross-validation.
- Metrics for tracking the accuracy and completeness of information extraction.
- Feedback mechanism from AGI agents or users on the quality/usefulness of analyst report data.
- Version control for extracted data to allow for corrections and updates.

### 6. Querying & Accessing Analyst Insights

- APIs for AGI agents and other systems to query and retrieve processed analyst report data from the KG.
- Support for queries like "latest price target for AAPL from Goldman Sachs," "average analyst rating for TSLA this quarter," "key bull/bear arguments for MSFT."
- Integration with analytical dashboards for visualizing analyst consensus, trends, and forecast accuracy.
- Ability for AGI agents to factor analyst sentiment and estimates into their decision-making models.
- Historical analysis of analyst forecast accuracy to weight their opinions appropriately.
- Search functionality across the full text of processed reports, indexed by extracted entities and concepts.

### Frontend Implementation (TypeScript/React) - (Analyst Report Data QA/Explorer UI)

```typescript
interface AnalystReportQAView {
  reportId: string;
  sourceUrlOrPath: string;
  extractedEntities: ExtractedAnalystEntity[]; // With confidence scores
  extractedEstimates: ExtractedFinancialEstimate[];
  rawTextContentView: string;
  validationControls: {
    markCorrect: () => void;
    flagError: () => void;
    editValue: (field, newValue) => void;
  };
  kgLinkageStatus: string;
}

interface ExtractedFinancialEstimate {
  metricName: "EPS" | "Revenue" | "PriceTarget";
  value: number;
  currency: string;
  fiscalPeriod: string; // e.g., 'Q4 2023', 'FY 2025'

- Licensing and copyright for analyst reports must be strictly adhered to.
- Start with a few key data points and a limited number of sources, then expand.
- Maintaining high data quality for financial estimates is critical.

## Future Enhancements
