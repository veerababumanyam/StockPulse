# Story 15.4: Create Dynamic Agent Team Composition

**Epic:** 15 - AGI Orchestration & Multi-Agent Coordination

**User Story:** As a user with complex financial needs, I want the system to automatically assemble the optimal team of specialized agents to address my specific situation comprehensively.

**Status:** To Do

## Business Context:
This story implements dynamic agent team composition that automatically assembles optimal teams of specialized AI agents based on the specific requirements of complex financial problems. This capability enables the platform to provide comprehensive solutions by combining diverse agent expertise, adapting team composition in real-time as problems evolve.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Intelligent Team Formation:**
   - Automated analysis of problem complexity and requirements to determine optimal team composition
   - Agent capability matching against problem requirements for team selection
   - Team size optimization balancing comprehensive coverage with coordination efficiency
   - Real-time team formation responding to urgent financial situations or market events

2. **Skill Complementarity Analysis:**
   - Identification of complementary agent skills and knowledge domains for comprehensive problem coverage
   - Gap analysis ensuring all required expertise is represented in the team
   - Redundancy elimination avoiding duplicate capabilities unless beneficial for validation
   - Specialization optimization assigning agents to their areas of highest competency

3. **Dynamic Team Adaptation:**
   - Real-time team membership adjustment as problems evolve or new requirements emerge
   - Agent substitution when team members become unavailable or underperform
   - Team scaling up or down based on problem complexity changes
   - Crisis response team formation for urgent financial situations requiring immediate attention

4. **Role Assignment and Coordination:**
   - Automatic role assignment based on agent capabilities and problem requirements
   - Team leadership designation for coordination and decision-making authority
   - Communication protocol establishment for efficient team collaboration
   - Responsibility matrix creation ensuring clear accountability for deliverables

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Team performance monitoring and optimization based on collaboration effectiveness
   - Learning from successful team compositions for future team formation
   - Conflict resolution mechanisms when team members have disagreements
   - Resource allocation optimization ensuring efficient use of computational resources

6. **User Interface and Transparency:**
   - Clear visualization of assembled teams and their composition rationale
   - Real-time team status and progress tracking for user awareness
   - Team member introduction and capability explanation for user understanding
   - Team recommendation system suggesting optimal teams for similar problems

## Technical Guidance:

### Backend Architecture:
- **Framework:** Python with optimization libraries (OptaPlanner, CVXPY) and team formation algorithms
- **Machine Learning:** Recommendation systems and collaborative filtering for team optimization
- **Graph Theory:** Network analysis for agent compatibility and communication efficiency
- **Real-time Systems:** Event-driven architecture for dynamic team adaptation

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/team-composition/form-team` - Create optimal agent team for specific problem
- `POST /api/team-composition/adapt-team` - Modify existing team based on evolving requirements
- `GET /api/team-composition/team-status` - Monitor team performance and member status
- `POST /api/team-composition/optimize` - Optimize team composition based on performance data
- `GET /api/team-composition/recommendations` - Get team composition recommendations

### Data Models:
```typescript
interface AgentTeam {
  teamId: string;
  problemId: string;
  teamComposition: TeamMember[];
  formationRationale: string;
  teamLeader: AgentId;
  coordinationProtocol: CoordinationProtocol;
  performanceMetrics: TeamPerformanceMetrics;
  status: 'forming' | 'active' | 'adapting' | 'completed' | 'disbanded';
  createdAt: Date;
}

interface TeamMember {
  agentId: string;
  role: string;
  responsibilities: string[];
  capabilities: AgentCapability[];
  selectionReason: string;
  performanceContribution: number;
  communicationLinks: AgentId[];
}

interface TeamFormationRequest {
  problemDescription: string;
  requiredCapabilities: string[];
  urgency: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  complexityLevel: number;
  preferredTeamSize: number;
  timeConstraints: TimeConstraint;
  resourceLimitations: ResourceConstraint[];
}
```

### Integration with Existing Systems:
- Utilizes Advanced A2A Coordination (Story 15.1) for team communication protocols
- Integrates with Collective Intelligence Framework (Story 15.2) for team performance
- Leverages existing agent capabilities from all previous epics for team member selection
- **Agent Design:** The ability of agents to be selected for, join, and effectively participate in dynamically formed teams is a key design consideration, governed by `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`.
