# Story 13.2: Develop AI Safety Constraint System

**Epic:** 13 - AGI Safety & Ethics Framework

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I need robust safety mechanisms that prevent AI agents from taking harmful actions or making dangerous recommendations under any circumstances.

**Status:** To Do

## Business Context:
This story implements comprehensive safety constraint systems that ensure AI agents cannot take harmful actions or make dangerous recommendations regardless of their learning processes, emergent behaviors, or external influences. These hard safety constraints are crucial for maintaining user trust and regulatory compliance as AI capabilities approach AGI levels.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Hard Safety Constraints:**
   - Immutable safety rules that cannot be overridden by learning algorithms or emergent behaviors
   - Financial safety limits preventing recommendations that could cause severe financial harm
   - Risk threshold enforcement ensuring all recommendations stay within acceptable risk parameters
   - Legal compliance constraints preventing actions that violate regulations or laws

2. **Real-Time Safety Monitoring:**
   - Continuous monitoring of all AI agent actions and recommendations for safety violations
   - Immediate intervention systems stopping unsafe actions before they can be executed
   - Anomaly detection identifying unusual patterns that might indicate safety breaches
   - Performance degradation detection that might indicate compromised safety systems

3. **Multi-Layer Safety Architecture:**
   - Primary safety layer at the individual agent level preventing unsafe recommendations
   - Secondary safety layer at the system level reviewing all cross-agent interactions
   - Tertiary safety layer at the user interface preventing unsafe actions from reaching users
   - Emergency override systems for immediate safety intervention when needed

4. **Contextual Safety Assessment:**
   - Dynamic safety rule adjustment based on user experience, risk tolerance, and financial situation
   - Market condition-aware safety constraints adapting to current volatility and risk levels
   - Regulatory environment monitoring ensuring compliance with current and evolving regulations
   - Cultural and regional safety considerations for international users

5. **Safety Learning and Adaptation:**
   - Safe learning mechanisms that improve safety detection without compromising safety constraints
   - Pattern recognition for identifying new types of potential safety violations
   - Community safety feedback integration learning from user reports and safety incidents
   - Proactive safety improvement based on near-miss detection and analysis

6. **Safety Transparency and Control:**
   - Clear explanation of safety constraints and their rationale to users
   - User-configurable safety levels within predetermined safe ranges
   - Safety audit trails documenting all safety interventions and their justification
   - Regular safety assessments and reporting for compliance and improvement

## Technical Guidance:

### Backend Architecture:
- **Framework:** Python with formal verification tools and constraint programming libraries
- **Safety Monitoring:** Real-time event processing with immediate response capabilities
- **Constraint Engine:** Rule-based systems with formal verification for constraint immutability
- **Override Systems:** Secure emergency intervention mechanisms with proper authentication

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/safety/check` - Validate actions against safety constraints before execution
- `GET /api/safety/constraints` - Retrieve current safety constraints and their status
- `POST /api/safety/report` - Report potential safety violations or concerns
- `GET /api/safety/audit` - Access safety audit trails and compliance reports
- `POST /api/safety/override` - Emergency safety override for authorized personnel

### Data Models:
```typescript
interface SafetyConstraint {
  constraintId: string;
  constraintType: 'financial_limit' | 'risk_threshold' | 'legal_compliance' | 'user_protection';
  description: string;
  enforcementLevel: 'hard' | 'soft' | 'advisory';
  parameters: ConstraintParameters;
  applicableAgents: string[];
  contextualRules: ContextualRule[];
  immutable: boolean;
}

interface SafetyViolation {
  violationId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  agentId: string;
  violatedConstraints: string[];
  attemptedAction: any;
  interventionTaken: string;
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  userImpact: ImpactAssessment;
  resolutionStatus: string;
}

interface SafetyMonitor {
  monitorId: string;
  monitorType: 'constraint_enforcement' | 'anomaly_detection' | 'performance_degradation';
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'maintenance';
  alertThresholds: ThresholdSettings;
  monitoredEntities: string[];
  lastCheck: Date;
  alertHistory: Alert[];
}
```

### Integration with Existing Systems:
- Monitors all AI agents for safety constraint compliance
- Integrates with Explainable AI (13.1) for safety decision transparency
- Coordinates with risk management systems for comprehensive protection
- **Agent Design:** The definition and enforcement of safety constraints, and how agents operate within these boundaries, must be a core part of agent design as specified in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`.
