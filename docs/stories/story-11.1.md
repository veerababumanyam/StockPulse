# Story 11.1: Implement Symbolic Reasoning Engine

**Epic:** 11 - AGI Foundation - Cognitive Architecture & Reasoning Engine

**User Story:** As a trader, I want an AI system that can perform logical reasoning and rule-based analysis to complement pattern recognition, so I can receive more comprehensive and explainable trading insights.

**Status:** To Do

## Business Context:
This story establishes the foundation for AGI by implementing symbolic reasoning capabilities that can perform logical inference, rule-based analysis, and knowledge representation. This enhances trading decisions by providing logical explanations alongside statistical patterns, building user trust through transparent reasoning.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Logical Inference Engine:**
   - Rule-based reasoning system for market analysis and trading decisions
   - Support for if-then logic rules (e.g., "If volatility > 30% AND volume > average, THEN increased risk probability")
   - Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) for complex condition evaluation
   - Inference chains that can trace reasoning steps from premises to conclusions

2. **Knowledge Representation Framework:**
   - Ontology system for financial concepts, relationships, and rules
   - Entity-relationship modeling for stocks, sectors, markets, and economic indicators
   - Rule definition interface for market experts to input domain knowledge
   - Version control and validation for knowledge base updates

3. **Rule-Based Analysis Integration:**
   - Integration with existing AI agents to provide logical explanations
   - Conflict resolution when rules contradict statistical predictions
   - Confidence scoring that combines logical reasoning with ML predictions
   - Real-time rule evaluation against live market data

4. **Explainable Logic Interface:**
   - Step-by-step reasoning chain visualization for users
   - Plain language explanations of logical conclusions
   - "Why" and "Why not" explanations for trading recommendations
   - Interactive rule exploration allowing users to understand decision logic

5. **Dynamic Rule Learning:**
   - System capability to propose new rules based on observed patterns
   - Expert validation workflow for automatically discovered rules
   - A/B testing framework for rule effectiveness measurement
   - Rule performance analytics and optimization recommendations

6. **Trading-Specific Logic:**
   - Risk assessment rules based on portfolio composition and market conditions
   - Sector rotation logic based on economic cycles and indicators
   - Technical analysis rules that complement chart pattern recognition
   - Compliance and regulatory rule checking for trading decisions

## Technical Guidance:

### Backend Architecture:
- **Framework:** Node.js/TypeScript with symbolic reasoning libraries (CLIPS, Prolog.js, or custom engine)
- **Rule Engine:** Production rule system with forward and backward chaining
- **Knowledge Base:** Graph-based storage in `StockPulse_VectorDB` with logical relationships
- **Integration:** RESTful APIs for rule evaluation and explanation generation
- **Agent Design:** Adhere to principles in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` for agent-specific configurations (LLM parameters, memory, tools).

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/reasoning/evaluate` - Evaluate rules against current market data
- `GET /api/reasoning/explain/{decision}` - Get logical explanation for a decision
- `POST /api/reasoning/rules` - Add or update reasoning rules
- `GET /api/reasoning/rules/conflicts` - Identify conflicting rules
- `POST /api/reasoning/validate` - Validate rule syntax and logic

### Data Models:
```typescript
interface ReasoningRule {
  ruleId: string;
  name: string;
  conditions: LogicalCondition[];
  conclusions: Conclusion[];
  confidence: number;
  source: 'expert' | 'discovered' | 'validated';
  active: boolean;
  performance: RulePerformance;
}

interface LogicalCondition {
  entity: string;
  operator: 'GT' | 'LT' | 'EQ' | 'IN' | 'CONTAINS';
  value: any;
  logicalOperator?: 'AND' | 'OR' | 'NOT';
}

interface ReasoningExplanation {
  conclusion: string;
  reasoning_chain: ReasoningStep[];
  confidence: number;
  supporting_rules: string[];
  contradicting_factors?: string[];
}
```

### Integration with AI Agents:
- Portfolio Analysis Agent receives logical explanations for diversification recommendations
- Market Insights Agent combines statistical patterns with logical market rules
- Trade Advisor Agent uses rule-based risk assessment alongside ML predictions

## Definition of Done:

- `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` for AI agent design and fine-tuning best practices.

## Notes:
- Start with basic financial logic rules and gradually increase complexity
- Ensure reasoning engine can handle real-time market data volumes
- Plan for scalability as rule base grows and complexity increases
- Consider performance implications of complex reasoning chains
- Implement gradual rollout to test reasoning quality before full deployment

## Future Enhancements:

- Fuzzy logic support for uncertain conditions and partial truths
- Temporal logic for time-based rules and sequence detection
- Integration with external financial knowledge bases and expert systems
- Quantum logic gates for advanced reasoning when quantum computing becomes available
- Self-modifying rules that optimize themselves based on performance feedback
