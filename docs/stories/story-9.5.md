# Story 9.5: Knowledge Base Consistency, Evolution & Governance Strategy

**Epic:** Epic 9: Data Analytics & Business Intelligence - Backend AI Data Pipelines & KB Management
**Story ID:** 9.5
**Story Title:** Knowledge Base Consistency, Evolution & Governance Strategy
**Assigned to:** Knowledge Management Team, AI Research Team, Data Governance Lead  
**Story Points:** 13

## Business Context
As the StockPulse platform relies on a comprehensive AGI Knowledge Graph (KG) fed by diverse and dynamic data pipelines (news, SEC filings, analyst reports, alternative data), I need a robust strategy and set of mechanisms for ensuring the ongoing consistency, accuracy, and graceful evolution of this KG. This includes managing conflicting information, updating a dynamic ontology, versioning knowledge, and establishing clear governance over the KG's content and structure.

## User Story
**As a** Knowledge Management Lead  
**I want to** establish a comprehensive strategy for Knowledge Base consistency, evolution, and governance  
**So that** the AGI Knowledge Graph remains a reliable, accurate, and adaptable foundation for AGI reasoning and decision-making, accommodating new information and evolving schemas while maintaining integrity.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Truth Maintenance & Conflict Resolution System
- Implementation of a truth maintenance system (TMS) or similar mechanisms to manage contradictory information ingested from different sources or at different times.
- Algorithms for assessing the credibility and timeliness of conflicting data points (e.g., based on source reliability, recency, corroborating evidence).
- Automated flagging of conflicting information for human review or AGI-mediated resolution.
- Strategies for merging or versioning conflicting facts, rather than simple overwriting.
- Logging of all conflict resolutions and the rationale behind them.
- Support for probabilistic knowledge representation to handle uncertainty.

### 2. Dynamic Ontology & Schema Evolution Management
- A defined process for updating and extending the KG ontology and schema as new concepts, entities, and relationships emerge or understanding evolves.
- Tools for managing ontology versions and migrating existing KG data to new schema versions with minimal disruption.
- Automated or semi-automated ontology learning techniques to suggest new concepts or relationships based on ingested data patterns.
- Governance process for approving changes to the core ontology, involving domain experts and knowledge engineers.
- Impact analysis tools to understand how schema changes might affect existing AGI agents, queries, or data pipelines.
- Documentation and communication plan for all ontology/schema updates.

### 3. Knowledge Versioning & Temporality
- All facts, entities, and relationships in the KG are timestamped (valid_from, valid_to, assertion_time) to support temporal reasoning and historical analysis.
- Version control for individual knowledge assertions, allowing rollback or retrieval of past states of knowledge.
- Ability to query the KG "as of" a specific point in time.
- Mechanisms for handling facts that are true only for a certain period (e.g., a CEO's tenure).
- Archival and retrieval strategies for outdated or historical knowledge.
- Efficient indexing and querying of temporal and versioned knowledge.

### 4. Knowledge Quality Monitoring & Auditing
- Continuous monitoring of KG quality metrics (e.g., completeness, consistency, accuracy, timeliness, connectedness).
- Automated detection of anomalies, inconsistencies, or orphan nodes/relationships in the KG.
- Regular KG audits, potentially involving both automated checks and human expert review.
- Dashboards for visualizing KG health and quality metrics.
- Feedback loops from AGI performance and user reports to identify and correct KG quality issues.
- Processes for curating and validating critical sections of the KG.

### 5. Governance Framework for Knowledge Management
- Establishment of a Knowledge Governance Council or working group with defined roles and responsibilities for KG oversight.
- Clear policies for data ingestion, knowledge representation standards, quality control, and ethical considerations for KG content.
- Processes for proposing, reviewing, and approving new data sources or major changes to KG structure.
- Access control and permissions for modifying different parts of the KG or its ontology.
- Regular review and updates to the knowledge governance framework itself.
- Training for data engineers, AI developers, and AGI agents (if applicable) on KG standards and best practices.

### 6. KG Backup, Recovery & Resilience
- Robust backup and recovery procedures for the entire Knowledge Graph infrastructure (graph database, vector stores, etc.).
- Regular testing of backup and recovery processes.
- High availability and disaster recovery (DR) strategy for critical KG components.
- Monitoring of KG infrastructure performance and capacity, with proactive scaling.
- Resilience against data corruption or accidental deletions.
- Data retention policies aligned with legal and business requirements.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] A basic conflict resolution mechanism is in place for a sample type of KG data (e.g., conflicting company revenue figures from two sources).
- [ ] A process for proposing and reviewing simple ontology changes (e.g., adding a new property to a node type) is defined and tested.
- [ ] Key facts in the KG are timestamped, and a basic query to retrieve data as of a past date is functional.
- [ ] At least two KG quality metrics (e.g., count of orphan nodes, average node connectivity) are monitored and displayed.
- [ ] A draft knowledge governance policy document is created, outlining roles and responsibilities.
- [ ] KG backup procedure is documented and successfully tested once.
- [ ] Conflicting data from two sources is flagged, and a resolution (manual or automated) is applied and logged.
- [ ] A simple change to the KG schema (e.g., adding a new allowed value for a property) is managed through the defined evolution process.
- [ ] The KG can store and differentiate between facts that are true now versus facts that were true in the past for a specific entity.
- [ ] A dashboard shows the current status of the defined KG quality metrics.
- [ ] The governance framework outlines how to handle a request for adding a new data source to the KG.

## Dependencies
- All preceding data ingestion pipelines (Stories 9.1-9.4).
- Foundational AGI Knowledge Graph & Semantic Memory Core (Story 14.1).
- AGI Safety & Ethics Framework (Epic 13) for ethical guidelines on knowledge content.

## Notes
- KG evolution and governance is a continuous, complex process, not a one-off task.
- Requires strong collaboration between data engineers, AI researchers, domain experts, and governance bodies.
- Balancing agility (quickly incorporating new knowledge) with stability (maintaining KG integrity) is key.
- Automation is crucial for managing large, dynamic KGs, but human oversight remains essential.

## Future Enhancements
- Fully automated ontology learning and evolution with minimal human intervention.
- Proactive KG self-healing and consistency enforcement.
- Advanced probabilistic reasoning over uncertain and conflicting knowledge.
- Using the KG to explain its own evolution and quality to users or auditors.
- Federated knowledge governance across multiple, interconnected KGs.
- AI-driven tools for suggesting schema optimizations or identifying redundant knowledge.
