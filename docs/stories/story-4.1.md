# Story 4.1: Implement AI-Enhanced Stock Search & Autocomplete

**As a** user (active trader or casual investor),
**I want** to search for stocks by symbol, company name, or natural language queries (e.g., "find undervalued tech stocks") with real-time autocomplete and AI-powered suggestions,
**So that** I can quickly and intuitively find relevant financial instruments.

## Description
This story focuses on creating a powerful and intuitive search experience for users to find stocks. The search should go beyond simple ticker matching and incorporate AI to understand user intent, provide intelligent suggestions, and handle natural language queries.

Key features include:
-   Input field for search queries.
-   Real-time autocomplete suggestions as the user types (symbols, company names).
-   AI-powered suggestions based on query context, potentially including related sectors, trending stocks, or stocks matching partial natural language queries.
-   Ability to interpret basic natural language queries (e.g., "tech stocks under $50 with good dividends", "pharmaceutical companies with recent breakthroughs").
-   Prioritization of search results based on relevance, popularity, and potentially user's portfolio or watchlist (future enhancement).
-   Clear presentation of search results, allowing users to easily navigate to the stock detail page.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Symbol Search:** When a user types a known stock symbol (e.g., AAPL), the system correctly identifies and suggests the corresponding stock, prioritizing exact matches.
2.  **AC2: Company Name Search:** When a user types a company name (e.g., "Apple"), the system suggests relevant stocks, handling variations in naming (e.g., "Apple Inc.").
3.  **AC3: Autocomplete Functionality:** As the user types (min 2-3 characters), a dropdown list of suggestions (symbols and company names) appears in real-time.
4.  **AC4: Natural Language Query (Basic):** The system can interpret simple natural language queries like "show me tech stocks" or "highest performing energy stocks this month" and return a list of relevant symbols/companies. The scope of NL understanding should be clearly defined for this iteration.
5.  **AC5: AI-Powered Suggestions:** For ambiguous queries or broad terms (e.g., "growth"), the search provides AI-driven suggestions that could include related ETFs, sectors, or specific stocks known for that characteristic.
6.  **AC6: Performance:** Search results and autocomplete suggestions load quickly (e.g., within 500ms for autocomplete, 2 seconds for full NLQ results).
7.  **AC7: Navigation:** Users can select a search result to navigate directly to the corresponding stock detail page (Story 4.2).
8.  **AC8: No Results Handling:** If no relevant results are found, a clear message is displayed to the user.
9.  **AC9: UI/UX:** The search bar is prominently displayed and easy to use. Results are presented clearly.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   Code implemented, reviewed, and merged to the main branch.
-   Unit tests written and passing with sufficient coverage (e.g., >80%) for the search logic and AI integration points.
-   Integration tests written and passing for the end-to-end search flow.
-   AI model for suggestions/NLQ is deployed and accessible by the search backend.
-   Relevant data sources for search (symbols, company names, financial data for NLQ) are identified and integrated.
-   Documentation for the search component and its AI integration updated.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) has reviewed and approved the implementation.
-   No major bugs identified post-testing.

## AI Integration Details

-   **Agent:** AI Market Insights Agent (or a specialized sub-agent for search).
-   **Models:** NLP models for query understanding, potentially a recommendation model for suggestions.
-   **Data Sources:** `StockPulse_PostgreSQL` (for symbol/company data), `StockPulse_VectorDB` (for semantic search capabilities, news, research to understand context for NLQ), real-time market data providers.
-   **Flow:**
    1.  User types query.
    2.  Frontend sends query to backend search service.
    3.  Search service interacts with AI Agent.
    4.  AI Agent processes query (NLP, semantic search, database lookups).
    5.  AI Agent returns structured results/suggestions to search service.
    6.  Search service forwards results to frontend.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Prominent search bar in the application header.
-   Clear distinction between typed text and suggestions.
-   Highlighting of matched keywords in results.
-   Consideration for mobile responsiveness.
-   Loading indicators for search operations.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 4: Stock Discovery & Analysis](../epic-4.md)
-   Stock Detail Page (Story 4.2) for navigation target.
-   AI Market Insights Agent (backend infrastructure).
-   Access to necessary databases and APIs.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Complexity of implementing robust Natural Language Query understanding. Initial scope needs to be well-defined.
-   Performance of AI-driven suggestions, especially with large datasets.
-   Scalability of the AI models and search infrastructure.
-   Data quality and freshness for accurate search results.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Performance:** As per AC6.
-   **Scalability:** System should handle an increasing number of users and stock symbols without degradation in performance.
-   **Reliability:** Search functionality should be highly available.
-   **Security:** Ensure queries do not expose sensitive information or allow for injection attacks.
