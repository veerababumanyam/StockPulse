# Story 14.5: Procedural Memory & Skill Acquisition System for AGI

**Epic:** Epic 14: AGI Context & Memory Systems
**Story ID:** 14.5
**Story Title:** Procedural Memory & Skill Acquisition System for AGI
**Assigned to:** AI Research Team, Robotics/Automation Team (if applicable)  
**Story Points:** 14

## Business Context
As an AGI developer, I need a procedural memory system that enables AGI agents to learn, store, and execute skills and procedures efficiently. This allows AGI to automate complex tasks, improve performance through practice, and adapt its behaviors to achieve goals in dynamic environments like financial trading or platform operations.

## User Story
**As an** AGI developer  
**I want to** implement a procedural memory and skill acquisition system  
**So that** AGI agents can learn, refine, and automatically execute complex sequences of actions (skills) to achieve their goals more effectively and efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Skill Representation & Storage
- A flexible representation for skills and procedures, accommodating sequences of actions, conditional logic (if-then-else), and loops.
- Storage of skills in a dedicated procedural memory, distinct from declarative (semantic/episodic) memory.
- Representation of skill parameters and context-dependencies (e.g., a trading skill might take `stock_symbol` and `order_type` as parameters).
- Hierarchical skill representation, allowing complex skills to be composed of simpler sub-skills.
- Versioning of skills to track improvements and allow rollback if needed.
- Ability to store both explicitly programmed skills and skills learned through experience.

### 2. Skill Learning & Acquisition Mechanisms
- Integration of various skill learning methods, including reinforcement learning (RL), imitation learning (learning from demonstration), and practice-based refinement.
- Mechanisms for AGI to discover new skills or improve existing ones through trial and error in simulated or real environments.
- Transfer learning capabilities to leverage existing skills when learning new, related skills.
- Chunking mechanisms to combine frequently co-occurring action sequences into new, more efficient skills.
- Interface for human experts to teach or demonstrate new skills to AGI agents.
- Feedback mechanisms for refining skills based on performance outcomes and error correction.

### 3. Context-Aware Skill Execution Engine
- An execution engine that can select and trigger appropriate skills based on the AGI's current goals, context, and perceived state of the environment.
- Smooth and efficient execution of learned procedures with minimal cognitive overhead.
- Real-time monitoring of skill execution, allowing for interruption or modification if the context changes unexpectedly.
- Ability to execute skills in parallel or sequence them appropriately.
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms during skill execution.
- Prioritization of conflicting skills or goals during execution.

### 4. Skill Refinement & Optimization
- Automated processes for optimizing learned skills for speed, efficiency, or resource consumption.
- Mechanisms for AGI to adapt its skills to changing environmental dynamics or task requirements.
- Generalization of skills to work effectively in novel but similar situations.
- Pruning of unused or ineffective skills from procedural memory.
- Benchmarking and performance tracking for individual skills.
- Use of AGI's episodic memory (Story 14.4) to evaluate the outcomes of skill execution and guide refinement.

### 5. Procedural Knowledge Sharing & Transfer
- Mechanisms for AGI agents to share learned skills with other AGI agents (if part of a multi-agent system).
- A standardized format for representing skills to facilitate transfer.
- Adaptation of transferred skills to the receiving agent's specific capabilities or context.
- Security considerations for skill sharing, preventing the spread of flawed or malicious procedures.
- Libraries of common, pre-trained skills relevant to the StockPulse domain.
- Human-understandable descriptions or documentation associated with learned skills.

### 6. Integration with Declarative Memory
- Interaction between procedural memory and declarative (semantic and episodic) memory systems.
- Use of semantic knowledge (Story 14.1) to understand the preconditions and effects of skills.
- Use of episodic memory (Story 14.4) to recall specific instances of skill execution and their outcomes, informing learning.
- Ability for AGI to reason about its own skills (e.g., "Do I know how to perform X?").
- Skills can be triggered based on declarative knowledge (e.g., if a certain market condition is detected in semantic memory, trigger a specific trading skill).
- Declarative memory can store meta-knowledge about skills, such as their applicability or typical performance.

### Frontend Implementation (TypeScript/React) - (AGI Skill Library & Editor)
```typescript
interface AGISkillManager {
  id: string;
  skillLibrary: SkillDefinition[];
  skillEditor: SkillGraphEditor; // For visualizing and editing skill logic
  learningMonitor: SkillLearningProgress[];
  executionTracer: SkillExecutionLog[];
}

interface SkillDefinition {
  skillId: string;
  skillName: string;
  description: string;
  skillType: 'sequential' | 'conditional' | 'hierarchical';
  parameters: SkillParameter[];
  performanceMetrics: PerformanceRecord[];
  complexityScore: number;
  learnedFrom: 'demonstration' | 'rl' | 'programmed';
}

interface SkillGraphEditorNode {
  nodeId: string;
  actionType: string; // e.g., 'API_CALL', 'READ_MEMORY', 'SUB_SKILL'
  actionParameters: Record<string, any>;
  condition?: string; // For conditional nodes
}
```

### AI Integration Components
- Reinforcement learning libraries (e.g., OpenAI Gym, Stable Baselines3, Ray RLlib).
- Imitation learning algorithms (e.g., Behavioral Cloning, GAIL).
- Production rule systems or state machines for skill representation.
- Automated planning systems (e.g., PDDL solvers) for skill composition.
- Simulation environments for practicing and refining skills.
- Robotics Operating System (ROS) if physical actions are involved (less likely for StockPulse initially).
- **Agent Design:** The mechanisms by which AGI agents learn, represent, execute, and refine skills are central to their operational capabilities and are guided by the principles in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`.
