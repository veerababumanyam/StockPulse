# Story 2.8: Implement Conversational Dashboard Interface

**Epic:** [Epic 2: Dashboard Core Functionality & Dynamic AG-UI Experience](../epic-2.md)

**Status:** To Do

**Priority:** High

**Estimated Effort:** 10 Story Points (2.5 weeks)

## User Story

**As a** user
**I want** to interact with my trading dashboard through natural conversation with AI agents
**So that** I can receive contextual insights, ask questions about market data, and get explanations with embedded visualizations in real-time

## Description

Implement a conversational interface that allows users to communicate with AI agents through natural language while receiving responses that include embedded AG-UI components. This creates a chat-style experience where agents can dynamically insert charts, tables, and other visualizations directly into the conversation flow, similar to modern conversational AI assistants but specifically designed for financial data analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Chat Interface Foundation**

   - [ ] Implement scrollable chat interface with agent avatars and timestamps
   - [ ] Support multiple concurrent agent conversations
   - [ ] Handle message threading and conversation context
   - [ ] Display typing indicators and agent status

2. **Natural Language Processing**

   - [ ] Parse user queries about market data, portfolio performance, and trading strategies
   - [ ] Support financial terminology and trading jargon
   - [ ] Handle follow-up questions and conversation continuity
   - [ ] Implement query suggestion and auto-completion

3. **Embedded Visualization System**

   - [ ] Render AG-UI components directly within conversation messages
   - [ ] Support inline charts, tables, alerts, and correlation matrices
   - [ ] Handle dynamic resizing of embedded components
   - [ ] Maintain component interactivity within chat context

4. **Contextual Response Generation**

   - [ ] Generate responses that combine text explanations with relevant visualizations
   - [ ] Adapt visualization complexity based on user expertise level
   - [ ] Provide drill-down capabilities from conversational insights
   - [ ] Support multi-step analysis workflows

5. **Voice Integration**

   - [ ] Accept voice input for hands-free interaction
   - [ ] Provide text-to-speech for agent responses
   - [ ] Handle noisy trading floor environments with noise cancellation
   - [ ] Support voice commands for chart manipulation

6. **Performance & UX**
   - [ ] Stream responses for immediate feedback (typewriter effect)
   - [ ] Load conversation history within 500ms
   - [ ] Support 100+ messages without performance degradation
   - [ ] Implement smart caching for frequently requested data

### Implementation Components

1. **Frontend Components**

   - `src/components/ag-ui/conversational/ConversationalDashboard.tsx`
   - `src/components/ag-ui/conversational/MessageRenderer.tsx`
   - `src/components/ag-ui/conversational/VoiceInputHandler.tsx`
   - `src/components/ag-ui/conversational/SuggestionEngine.tsx`
   - `src/components/ag-ui/conversational/ChatterboxTTSService.tsx`

2. **Backend Services**

   - Natural language processing pipeline
   - Conversation context management
   - Embedded visualization generation
   - Chatterbox TTS integration with emotion control
   - Voice processing integration

3. **Example Conversation Flow with Voice**

   ```
   User: "Show me AAPL's performance today"

   Agent: "AAPL is up 2.3% today, currently trading at $185.40.
           Here's the intraday chart with volume analysis:

           {{component:aapl-intraday-chart}}

           The stock broke through resistance at $184 around 2 PM
           with increased volume. Would you like me to analyze
           the technical indicators?"

   [Voice Output: Calm, professional tone with slight enthusiasm]
   [Emotion Level: 0.6 for positive market news]

   User: "Yes, add RSI and MACD"

   Agent: "Added RSI and MACD to your chart. RSI is at 67,
           approaching overbought territory, while MACD shows
           bullish momentum with a recent crossover."

   [Voice Output: Slightly more urgent tone for overbought warning]
   [Emotion Level: 0.7 for cautionary information]
   ```

4. **Chatterbox TTS Integration**

   ```typescript
   export class ChatterboxTTSService {
     private model: ChatterboxTTS;

     async initialize() {
       this.model = await ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained({ device: "cuda" });
     }

     async generateSpeech(
       text: string,
       voiceConfig: VoiceConfig,
       marketContext?: MarketContext,
     ): Promise<AudioBuffer> {
       const emotionLevel = this.calculateEmotionLevel(
         voiceConfig,
         marketContext,
       );

       const audioData = await this.model.generate(text, {
         emotion_level: emotionLevel,
         speaking_rate: voiceConfig.speed,
         audio_prompt_path: voiceConfig.agentVoice,
       });

       return audioData;
     }

     private calculateEmotionLevel(
       config: VoiceConfig,
       marketContext?: MarketContext,
     ): number {
       let baseEmotion = config.emotionLevel;

       if (marketContext?.volatility > 0.3) baseEmotion += 0.2;
       if (marketContext?.alertLevel === "critical") baseEmotion += 0.3;

       return Math.min(1.0, baseEmotion);
     }
   }
   ```
