# Story 8.21: Implement Earnings Event Analysis Agent

**Epic:** [Epic 8: Enhanced AI Agents & Intelligence](../epic-8.md)

**Status:** To Do

**Priority:** High

**Estimated Effort:** 15 Story Points (3.75 weeks)

## User Story

**As a** equity trader or fundamental analyst
**I want** an AI agent that analyzes earnings events, processes earnings calls and transcripts, and predicts market reactions to earnings surprises
**So that** I can make informed trading decisions around earnings announcements, detect earnings momentum, and identify value opportunities from market overreactions

## Description

Implement a specialized AI agent focused on earnings events that monitors earnings calendars, analyzes earnings call transcripts using advanced NLP, detects earnings surprises, and predicts post-earnings price movements. This agent uses machine learning to understand management sentiment, guidance changes, and analyst reaction patterns to provide comprehensive earnings intelligence.

The agent integrates with the AG-UI framework to provide dynamic earnings dashboards that adapt based on earnings season intensity and individual stock earnings proximity, featuring voice-activated earnings briefings and conversational earnings analysis.
