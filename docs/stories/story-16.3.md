### Agent Design Considerations:
- Individual AI agents within the self-evolving AGI architecture must be designed with modularity and adaptability in mind. Their internal structures and interfaces should allow for dynamic reconfiguration and replacement by the quantum annealing process. The design of these agents must adhere to the principles outlined in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` to ensure they can participate in and benefit from the evolutionary process.
