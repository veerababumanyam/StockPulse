# Story 8.4: Create AI Forecasting Engine for Equity Prices & Market Trends

**As a** user (investor, trader, or analyst),
**I want** access to AI-generated probabilistic forecasts for individual equity prices, broader market trends (e.g., indices), and potentially sector movements,
**So that** I can incorporate forward-looking insights into my investment decisions, complementing other analytical methods.

## Description
This story involves developing a sophisticated "AI Forecasting Agent" that uses various models (time-series, machine learning, potentially incorporating fundamental data and sentiment) to generate forecasts. Emphasis will be on probabilistic forecasts, clearly communicating uncertainty.

Key features include:
-   **Equity Price Forecasts:**
    *   Generate short-term to medium-term probabilistic forecasts for selected individual stocks (e.g., price range, probability of up/down movement, target price distribution).
    *   AI models could include ARIMA, GARCH, LSTMs, Prophet, or custom ensembles.
-   **Market & Sector Trend Forecasts:**
    *   Generate forecasts for major market indices (e.g., S&P 500, NASDAQ) and potentially key sectors.
    *   Identify potential trend continuations or reversals.
-   **Volatility Forecasts:**
    *   Predict future volatility for specific instruments or the market, which is crucial for risk management and options trading.
-   **AI Integration - AI Forecasting Agent:**
    *   Develops, trains, and maintains the forecasting models.
    *   Regularly updates forecasts as new data becomes available.
    *   Manages different models for different asset classes or forecast horizons.
-   **Clear Presentation of Forecasts:**
    *   Visualize forecasts with confidence intervals or probability distributions (e.g., fan charts).
    *   Provide context, such as key assumptions or factors influencing the forecast.
    *   Clearly state that forecasts are not guarantees and have inherent uncertainty.
-   Users can potentially see historical forecast accuracy for specific models/instruments (backtesting results summary).

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Equity Price Forecasts (Probabilistic):** The AI Forecasting Agent can generate and display probabilistic price forecasts (e.g., a predicted range with confidence levels) for a defined set of at least 10-20 liquid stocks for a short-term horizon (e.g., 1-week, 1-month).
2.  **AC2: Market Index Forecast:** The agent can generate and display a probabilistic forecast for at least one major market index (e.g., S&P 500) for a short-term horizon.
3.  **AC3: Model Inputs:** Forecasting models utilize historical price/volume data, and potentially at least one other data type (e.g., basic news sentiment from Story 6.6 or key fundamentals from Story 6.5).
4.  **AC4: Uncertainty Communication:** Forecasts are presented with clear indications of uncertainty (e.g., confidence bands, probability distributions).
5.  **AC5: Regular Updates:** Forecasts are updated periodically (e.g., daily or weekly) as new data becomes available.
6.  **AC6: AI Agent Functionality:** The AI Forecasting Agent backend is responsible for all model training, inference, and result generation.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   The AI Forecasting Engine is generating and displaying probabilistic forecasts for selected equities and a market index.
-   Uncertainty is clearly communicated.
-   Backend AI agent and models are operational.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and relevant tests (including model validation/backtesting procedures) passed.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) and a quantitative analyst have reviewed the forecast outputs for plausibility and clarity.

## AI Integration Details

-   **AI Forecasting Agent:**
    *   Core of this story. Involves selecting, developing, training, and evaluating various forecasting models (e.g., time series models like ARIMA/SARIMA, machine learning models like LSTMs, Gradient Boosting, or hybrid approaches).
    *   May incorporate features from technical analysis, fundamental data (Story 6.5, 8.5), news sentiment (Story 6.6), and macroeconomic data (Story 6.10) over time.
    *   Continuous model monitoring and retraining will be essential.
    *   Results can be used as inputs for other agents (e.g., AI Portfolio Optimizer Agent in Story 8.3 for expected returns).

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Presenting probabilistic forecasts intuitively is challenging. Use clear visualizations and simple language.
-   Educate users about the nature of financial forecasts and their limitations (link to Story 7.5 content).
-   Avoid creating a false sense of certainty. Emphasize that these are aids, not crystal balls.
-   Allow users to easily access methodology notes or high-level descriptions of how forecasts are generated.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 8: Advanced Analytics & Insights](../epic-8.md)
-   Epic 6 (Data Sources & Market Integration) for rich historical and real-time data feeds.
-   Story 6.9 (Internal Data Access API Layer).
-   Story 7.7 (AI Meta-Agent/Orchestrator Backend) for managing the AI Forecasting Agent.
-   Significant data science and MLOps effort for model development and maintenance.
-   `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB` and other databases for model inputs and outputs.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Financial forecasting is notoriously difficult; managing user expectations regarding accuracy is paramount.
-   Choosing the right models and features for different assets and horizons.
-   Model overfitting and ensuring robustness.
-   Computational resources for training and running many forecasting models.
-   Ethical implications of providing AI-generated financial forecasts.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Model Plausibility:** Forecasts should be plausible and align with financial theory, even if not always perfectly accurate.
-   **Scalability:** The engine should be able to generate forecasts for a growing number of instruments.
-   **Maintainability:** Forecasting models and pipelines must be maintainable and updatable.
-   **Transparency (Methodological):** High-level explanation of forecast generation methods should be available.
