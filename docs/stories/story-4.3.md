# Story 4.3: Integrate Interactive Price Charts

**As a** user (active trader or casual investor),
**I want** to view interactive price charts (intraday and historical) with features like zoom, timescale selection, and common technical overlays (e.g., moving averages, volume bars) on the stock detail page,
**So that** I can analyze price trends and patterns to inform my investment decisions.

## Description
This story focuses on providing users with robust charting capabilities on the Stock Detail Page (Story 4.2). The chart should be interactive, allowing users to explore price data across different timeframes and apply basic technical analysis tools.

Key features include:
-   Display of line or candlestick charts for stock prices.
-   Timescale selection (e.g., 1D, 5D, 1M, 6M, YTD, 1Y, 5Y, Max).
-   Intraday charting with selectable intervals (e.g., 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 1 hour) for the 1D view.
-   Zoom and pan functionality on the chart.
-   Volume bars displayed beneath the price chart.
-   Ability to overlay common technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages - SMA/EMA, Bollinger Bands, RSI). The initial set of indicators should be defined.
-   Display of price/value at the cursor position on the chart (crosshair/tooltip).
-   Clear labeling of axes (date/time and price).

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Chart Display:** An interactive price chart is displayed within the designated area on the Stock Detail Page (Story 4.2).
2.  **AC2: Default View:** The chart defaults to a specific timescale (e.g., 1D line chart) upon page load.
3.  **AC3: Timescale Selection:** Users can select different historical timescales (e.g., 1D, 5D, 1M, 6M, YTD, 1Y, 5Y, Max), and the chart updates accordingly with the correct data.
4.  **AC4: Intraday Intervals:** For the 1D timescale, users can select different intraday intervals (e.g., 1-min, 5-min, 15-min), and the chart updates.
5.  **AC5: Zoom and Pan:** Users can zoom in/out and pan the chart to view specific periods in more detail.
6.  **AC6: Volume Chart:** A volume chart is displayed, typically below the price chart, corresponding to the selected timescale.
7.  **AC7: Technical Overlays (Basic):** Users can select and display at least two common technical indicators (e.g., SMA 50/200, Volume) on the chart. Indicator parameters (e.g., period for SMA) should be configurable if possible, or use sensible defaults.
8.  **AC8: Crosshair/Tooltip:** Moving the cursor over the chart displays a crosshair and a tooltip showing the date/time, open, high, low, close (OHLC), and volume for the selected data point.
9.  **AC9: Data Accuracy:** Chart data (prices, volume) is accurate and matches the data from the backend market data service.
10. **AC10: Performance:** Charts load quickly, and interactions (zoom, pan, timescale change) are smooth and responsive.
11. **AC11: UI/UX:** Chart controls are intuitive and the chart itself is visually clear and easy to interpret.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   Selected charting library integrated and configured.
-   Code implemented, reviewed, and merged to the main branch.
-   Unit tests for chart component logic (e.g., data transformations, state changes).
-   Integration tests for data fetching and chart rendering.
-   Backend API for historical and intraday price data is integrated and functional.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) has reviewed and approved the chart functionality.
-   Chart is responsive and adheres to design guidelines.

## AI Integration Details

-   **Note:** While this story focuses on traditional charting, future stories under this epic or other AI-focused epics might involve AI-suggested chart patterns, anomaly detection on charts, or AI-driven technical analysis summaries. For this story, AI integration is out of scope, but the design should be flexible enough not to hinder future AI enhancements.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Clear and intuitive controls for timescale, chart type (line/candlestick), and indicators.
-   Sufficient contrast and readability for chart elements.
-   Responsive design to ensure usability on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
-   Loading indicator while chart data is being fetched.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 4: Stock Discovery & Analysis](../epic-4.md)
-   Stock Detail Page (Story 4.2) - as the host for this chart.
-   Backend market data service providing historical and intraday OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data.
-   A chosen charting library (e.g., TradingView Lightweight Charts, Recharts, Chart.js, etc.).

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Selection of the most suitable charting library (balancing features, performance, ease of integration, licensing).
-   Defining the initial set of technical indicators and their default parameters.
-   Handling large datasets for historical charts efficiently to maintain performance.
-   Ensuring real-time updates for intraday charts are smooth if live ticking is required (may be a separate follow-up story if complex).

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Performance:** Chart loading and interactions should be very responsive (e.g., timescale changes < 1 second).
-   **Accuracy:** Chart data must be highly accurate.
-   **Usability:** Chart should be easy to use for both novice and experienced traders.
