# Story 8.2: Develop AI-Powered Portfolio Risk Analyzer (VaR, Stress Testing, Scenario Modeling)

**As a** user (investor or portfolio manager),
**I want** an AI-powered portfolio risk analysis tool that can calculate metrics like Value at Risk (VaR), perform stress tests against historical or hypothetical market shocks, and allow for scenario modeling,
**So that** I can better understand my portfolio's potential downside, its resilience to adverse conditions, and the impact of different market events.

## Description
This story focuses on building sophisticated risk analysis capabilities for user portfolios, utilizing AI techniques for modeling and analysis.

Key features include:
-   **Value at Risk (VaR) Calculation:**
    *   Calculate VaR for the user's portfolio at different confidence levels (e.g., 95%, 99%) and time horizons (e.g., 1-day, 10-day).
    *   Support for multiple VaR methodologies (e.g., historical simulation, parametric VaR, Monte Carlo VaR), with AI potentially suggesting the most appropriate method or parameters.
-   **Stress Testing Module:**
    *   Allow users to test their portfolio against predefined historical market stress events (e.g., 2008 financial crisis, COVID-19 crash, 1987 Black Monday).
    *   Allow users to define custom stress scenarios (e.g., "10% drop in S&P 500," "2% rise in interest rates," "specific stock drops 30%").
    *   Display the potential impact on portfolio value and key holdings.
-   **Scenario Modeling ("What-if" Analysis):**
    *   Enable users to model the impact of hypothetical changes to their portfolio (e.g., "What if I buy 100 shares of X?", "What if I sell all Y?").
    *   Show projected changes to overall portfolio risk and return metrics.
-   **AI Integration - AI Portfolio Optimizer Agent:**
    *   This agent will perform the complex calculations and simulations.
    *   It may use machine learning to model correlations between assets or predict asset behavior under stress.
    *   It will present results in an understandable way, highlighting key risk drivers.
-   Clear visualization of risk metrics, stress test outcomes, and scenario impacts.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: VaR Calculation Implemented:** The system can calculate and display portfolio VaR using at least one methodology (e.g., historical simulation) for user-defined confidence levels and horizons.
2.  **AC2: Historical Stress Testing:** Users can select from a list of at least 2-3 predefined historical stress events and see the simulated impact on their portfolio value.
3.  **AC3: Custom Stress Scenario Definition:** Users can define and run a custom stress scenario by specifying a shock to a major market index or a specific holding.
4.  **AC4: Basic Scenario Modeling:** Users can model the impact of adding or removing a position from their portfolio and see the effect on a key risk metric (e.g., overall portfolio VaR or volatility).
5.  **AC5: AI Agent Integration:** The AI Portfolio Optimizer Agent is responsible for performing the backend calculations for VaR, stress tests, and scenario models.
6.  **AC6: Results Visualization:** Risk analysis results (VaR figures, stress test impacts, scenario outcomes) are presented clearly in the UI, possibly with charts or summary tables.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   The AI-Powered Portfolio Risk Analyzer is functional, providing VaR, stress testing, and basic scenario modeling capabilities.
-   The AI Portfolio Optimizer Agent correctly performs the underlying calculations.
-   Results are clearly presented and understandable to the user.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and relevant tests (unit, integration, potentially backtests for model components) passed.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) and a sample user (e.g., sophisticated investor) have validated the tool's functionality and clarity of results.

## AI Integration Details

-   **AI Portfolio Optimizer Agent:**
    *   Implements methodologies for VaR calculation (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations requiring generation of correlated random asset returns, historical simulation).
    *   Models asset behavior under various stress scenarios.
    *   May use ML to estimate covariance matrices or factor models for better risk representation.
    *   Requires access to portfolio holdings (Epic 3), historical market data (Epic 6), and potentially user risk profiles (Story 7.3).

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Risk concepts can be complex; UI must present information clearly, with explanations and appropriate caveats.
-   Input for scenarios should be intuitive.
-   Visualization is key to making risk data digestible (e.g., charts showing potential loss distributions, impact summaries).
-   Clearly state assumptions and limitations of the models used.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 8: Advanced Analytics & Insights](../epic-8.md)
-   Epic 3 (Detailed Portfolio Management) for accessing user portfolio holdings.
-   Epic 6 (Data Sources & Market Integration) for historical price/volatility data.
-   Story 6.9 (Internal Data Access API Layer).
-   Story 7.7 (AI Meta-Agent/Orchestrator Backend) for managing the AI Portfolio Optimizer Agent.
-   Robust computational backend for potentially intensive simulations.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Complexity of accurately modeling risk and asset correlations, especially during extreme market conditions.
-   Communicating model limitations and not giving a false sense of precision.
-   Computational cost of running simulations (e.g., Monte Carlo VaR) for many users.
-   Selection of appropriate methodologies for different risk calculations.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Accuracy:** Risk calculations should be based on sound financial models and accurate data.
-   **Performance:** While some calculations are intensive, results should be delivered within a reasonable timeframe. Consider asynchronous processing for very complex analyses.
-   **Understandability:** Outputs must be interpretable by users who may not be quantitative finance experts.
-   **Reliability:** The risk analysis engine must be stable.
