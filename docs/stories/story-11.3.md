# Story 11.3: Build Cross-Domain Knowledge Integration System

**Epic:** 11 - AGI Foundation - Cognitive Architecture & Reasoning Engine

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI agents that can apply insights from one domain (e.g., market psychology) to enhance analysis in another domain (e.g., portfolio optimization) for more holistic intelligence.

**Status:** To Do

## Business Context:
This story implements cross-domain knowledge integration that enables AI agents to transfer insights and patterns between different fields of knowledge, creating more comprehensive and innovative analysis. This capability moves beyond narrow AI specialization toward general intelligence that can find connections and opportunities across diverse domains.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Cross-Domain Knowledge Graph:**
   - Unified knowledge representation connecting financial, psychological, economic, and technological domains
   - Concept mapping between different fields (e.g., market sentiment â†” crowd psychology)
   - Relationship inference engine discovering connections between disparate domains
   - Knowledge validation framework ensuring cross-domain connections are meaningful

2. **Domain Transfer Learning:**
   - Pattern recognition system that identifies similar structures across different domains
   - Analogical reasoning engine applying solutions from one domain to problems in another
   - Cross-domain insight generation using patterns from psychology, economics, and behavioral science
   - Validation mechanisms to test cross-domain insights against real market data

3. **Multi-Domain Analysis Integration:**
   - Portfolio optimization enhanced with psychological bias detection and behavioral patterns
   - Market sentiment analysis incorporating crowd psychology and social dynamics research
   - Risk assessment using insights from behavioral economics and decision science
   - Technical analysis combined with pattern recognition from other scientific fields

4. **Knowledge Source Integration:**
   - Integration with academic research databases from finance, psychology, economics, and technology
   - Real-time incorporation of insights from multiple industry sectors
   - Cross-referencing financial events with patterns from other domains
   - Automated discovery of relevant research and insights from related fields

5. **Adaptive Domain Expansion:**
   - System capability to identify when insights from new domains could be valuable
   - Automatic incorporation of relevant knowledge from emerging fields
   - User-specific domain integration based on interests and trading focus areas
   - Continuous learning framework expanding domain knowledge based on success patterns

6. **Cross-Domain Explanation Generation:**
   - Natural language explanations connecting insights across domains
   - Visual representations showing how knowledge from different fields contributes to recommendations
   - Educational components helping users understand cross-domain connections
   - Confidence scoring for cross-domain insights and their applicability

## Technical Guidance:

### Backend Architecture:
- **Framework:** Node.js/TypeScript with Python ML services for cross-domain analysis
- **Knowledge Integration:** Graph databases and semantic networks for domain connections
- **Knowledge Storage:** `StockPulse_VectorDB` for embedding-based cross-domain similarities
- **Research Integration:** APIs for accessing academic databases and research repositories
- **Agent Design:** Adhere to principles in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` for agent-specific configurations (LLM parameters, memory, tools).

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/cross-domain/analyze` - Perform cross-domain analysis for specific scenarios
- `GET /api/cross-domain/connections/{concept}` - Discover cross-domain connections for concepts
- `POST /api/cross-domain/insights` - Generate insights using multi-domain knowledge
- `GET /api/cross-domain/domains` - List available knowledge domains and their connections
- `POST /api/cross-domain/validate` - Validate cross-domain insights against historical data

### Data Models:
```typescript
interface CrossDomainKnowledge {
  knowledgeId: string;
  sourceDomain: string;
  targetDomain: string;
  concept: string;
  analogy: DomainAnalogy;
  confidence: number;
  validationResults: ValidationMetrics;
  applicability: ApplicabilityScore;
  sources: ResearchSource[];
}

interface DomainAnalogy {
  sourcePattern: any;
  targetPattern: any;
  analogyType: 'structural' | 'functional' | 'causal' | 'temporal';
  mappingRules: MappingRule[];
  strengthScore: number;
}

interface CrossDomainInsight {
  insightId: string;
  integratedDomains: string[];
  insight: string;
  supportingEvidence: Evidence[];
  actionableRecommendations: string[];
  confidence: number;
  noveltySCore: number;
}
```

### Integration with Existing Agents:
- Portfolio Analysis Agent receives behavioral economics insights for bias-aware optimization
- Market Insights Agent incorporates social psychology patterns for sentiment analysis
- Risk Assessment Agent uses decision science research for improved risk modeling
