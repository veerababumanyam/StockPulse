### Frontend Implementation (TypeScript/React)
```typescript
interface EthicalDecisionFramework {
  id: string;
  decisionContext: DecisionContext;
  ethicalFrameworks: EthicalFramework[];
  biasAssessment: BiasAssessment;
  stakeholderImpact: StakeholderImpact[];
  ethicalScore: EthicalScore;
  transparency: TransparencyReport;
}

interface EthicalFramework {
  name: 'utilitarian' | 'deontological' | 'virtue_ethics' | 'care_ethics';
  score: number;
  reasoning: string;
  confidence: number;
  applicability: number;
  culturalConsiderations: string[];
}

interface BiasAssessment {
  overallBiasScore: number;
  demographicBias: number;
  economicBias: number;
  culturalBias: number;
  temporalBias: number;
  mitigationStrategies: MitigationStrategy[];
  fairnessMetrics: FairnessMetric[];
}

interface StakeholderImpact {
  stakeholderType: 'user' | 'market' | 'society' | 'environment';
  impactScore: number;
  impactDescription: string;
  mitigationMeasures: string[];

}
```

### AI Integration Components
- Multi-framework ethical reasoning engine
- Bias detection and analysis algorithms
- Stakeholder impact modeling AI
- Ethical explanation generation system
- Cultural context understanding models
- Continuous ethical learning algorithms
- **Agent Design:** All AI agents must be designed to operate within this ethical framework, and their decision-making processes must be auditable against these ethical principles, as outlined in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`.

### Database Schema Updates
