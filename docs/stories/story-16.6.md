### Agent Design Considerations:
- AGI agents that are either emulated by or interact with neuromorphic quantum components represent a new frontier. Their design must consider how to translate traditional agent functions (perception, action, learning) into this new paradigm. If classical agents interact with nQPU-emulated cognitive functions, they need clear APIs and understanding of the nQPU's capabilities and outputs. All designs must strictly follow the ethical and safety guidelines outlined in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` and Epic 13, given the advanced nature of this research.
