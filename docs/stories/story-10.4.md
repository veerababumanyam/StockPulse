# Story 10.4: Advanced Alerting & Notification System for Administrators

**Epic:** Epic 10: Platform Administration & Observability
**Story ID:** 10.4
**Story Title:** Advanced Alerting & Notification System for Administrators
**Assigned to:** DevOps Team, Backend Team
**Story Points:** 9

## Business Context
As a StockPulse platform administrator, I need an advanced alerting and notification system that proactively informs me of critical system issues, performance degradations, security events, or AGI anomalies. This system must support configurable alert rules, multiple notification channels, and escalation policies to ensure timely awareness and response to maintain platform health and reliability.

## User Story
**As a** platform administrator
**I want to** have an advanced alerting and notification system
**So that** I am promptly informed of critical issues, performance anomalies, or security events through preferred channels, enabling quick response and remediation to maintain platform stability and security.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Configurable Alert Rules Engine
- Ability to define alert rules based on metrics from various sources (system logs, application performance monitoring, AGI component outputs, security event logs).
- Support for complex alert conditions (e.g., thresholds, rate of change, anomaly detection, combinations of metrics).
- User interface for creating, managing, and testing alert rules.
- Version control for alert rule configurations.
- Ability to set different severity levels for alerts (e.g., critical, warning, informational).
- Templates for common alert rules (e.g., high CPU usage, high error rate, AGI prediction drift).

### 2. Multi-Channel Alert Notifications
- Integration with multiple notification channels for administrators (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications to a dedicated admin app, chat platforms like Slack/Microsoft Teams).
- User-configurable preferences for receiving alerts on specific channels based on severity or source.
- Deduplication of alerts to avoid notification fatigue.
- Rich alert notifications containing key information (alert name, severity, affected service, timestamp, summary, link to dashboard).
- Support for acknowledging alerts directly from notifications where feasible.
- Quiet hours or DND settings for non-critical alert notifications for administrators.

### 3. Escalation Policies & On-Call Scheduling
- Ability to define escalation policies for unacknowledged critical alerts (e.g., notify a secondary admin or team after X minutes).
- Integration with on-call scheduling tools (e.g., PagerDuty, Opsgenie) or a built-in scheduler for routing alerts to the correct on-call personnel.
- Support for rotating on-call schedules.
- Manual escalation option for administrators.
- Clear tracking of alert acknowledgment and escalation history.
- Different escalation paths based on alert severity or source system.

### 4. Alert Correlation & Grouping
- Mechanisms to correlate related alerts from different sources to identify a single underlying issue (reducing alert noise).
- Automated grouping of similar or frequently occurring alerts.
- Contextual information provided with grouped alerts to aid in diagnosis.
- Machine learning-based alert clustering to identify novel patterns of failures (future).
- Suppression of flapping alerts (alerts that trigger and resolve repeatedly in a short time).
- Root cause analysis hints based on correlated alert patterns.

### 5. Alert Dashboard & Lifecycle Management
- A centralized dashboard displaying active alerts, their severity, status (active, acknowledged, resolved), and history.
- Ability for administrators to acknowledge, assign, or close alerts.
- Filtering and sorting of alerts by severity, source, timestamp, assignee.
- Metrics on alert volume, mean time to acknowledge (MTTA), and mean time to resolve (MTTR).
- Audit trail for all alert lifecycle changes.
- Integration with the Centralized Logging & Monitoring Dashboard (Story 10.3) for quick drill-down.

### 6. Integration with AGI System Monitoring
- Specific alerts for AGI component health, performance, and ethical/safety metric deviations (linking to Epic 13 & 14 monitoring).
- Alerts for AGI model prediction drift, data input anomalies, or unexpected behavior.
- Thresholds for AGI-specific KPIs (e.g., AGI decision confidence, resource consumption by AGI tasks).
- Alerts when AGI safety or control mechanisms are triggered (Story 13.4).
- Notification to designated AGI ethics or safety personnel for specific AGI-related alerts.
- Feedback from AGI system state into the alerting rules (e.g., AGI detects an anomaly and triggers an admin alert).

### AI Integration Components
- Anomaly detection models for metrics to trigger alerts (AIOps).
- AI-powered alert correlation and root cause suggestion.
- NLP for parsing alert messages or creating human-readable summaries from technical alerts.
- Predictive alerting based on trend analysis of metrics.
- **Agent Design:** Adhere to principles in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` for AI components involved in alert generation, correlation, or AGI-specific alerting logic.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Administrators can define a basic alert rule based on a metric (e.g., CPU > 80% for 1 min) via a UI or config file.
- [ ] An alert is successfully triggered when the defined condition is met for a test metric.
- [ ] The triggered alert is delivered to at least one configured administrator channel (e.g., email).
- [ ] A basic alert dashboard shows active alerts with severity and timestamp.
- [ ] Administrators can acknowledge an active alert via the UI.
- [ ] An escalation policy is defined to notify a secondary contact if a critical alert is not acknowledged within X minutes (tested conceptually or in simulation).
- [ ] Alert deduplication prevents multiple identical alerts from being sent within a short window.
- [ ] Alerts generated from AGI component monitoring (e.g. high error rate in an AGI model) are handled by this system.

## Dependencies
- Centralized Logging & Monitoring Dashboard (Story 10.3) - for metrics and log data to trigger alerts.
- Platform Administrator User Management System (Story 10.2) - for admin contact details and preferences.
- Specific monitoring capabilities for AGI components (Epics 13, 14, etc.).
- Notification service providers (email, SMS, chat platforms).
- `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` for AI agent design and fine-tuning best practices.

## Notes
- Effective alerting is crucial for proactive incident response.
- Fine-tuning alert rules to minimize false positives and false negatives is an ongoing process.
- Avoid alert fatigue by ensuring alerts are actionable and relevant.
- Security of the alerting system itself (e.g., preventing spoofed alerts or modification of rules) is important.

## Future Enhancements
- AIOps-driven features like automated root cause analysis and predictive alerting.
- Self-healing capabilities where alerts trigger automated remediation scripts.
- User-defined alert silencing or maintenance windows.
- Integration with ticketing systems (e.g., Jira Service Desk) to create incidents automatically.
- Visualizations of alert trends and patterns over time.
- Gamification or leaderboards for MTTA/MTTR to incentivize quick response (use with caution).
