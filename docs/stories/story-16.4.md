- AI agents handling sensitive data or communicating across the network must be designed to utilize the platform's QRC capabilities. This includes being aware of quantum-safe protocols for key exchange, data encryption, and secure communication. Agent interactions and data handling procedures must align with the QRC framework and the principles in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` to ensure end-to-end security in a post-quantum world.
