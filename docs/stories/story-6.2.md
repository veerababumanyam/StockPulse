# Story 6.2: Implement Historical Equity Price/Volume Data Ingestion & Storage

**As a** system (StockPulse platform and its AI agents),
**I need** to ingest, process, and store historical equity price and volume data (OHLCV - Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) from one or more providers,
**So that** AI agents can perform backtesting and model training, users can view historical charts, and the platform can conduct historical analysis.

## Description
This story focuses on acquiring and managing historical market data for equities. This includes daily, hourly, and potentially minute-level (or even tick-level, if feasible and required for specific AI use cases) OHLCV data for a comprehensive range of symbols and for a significant historical depth (e.g., 10-20+ years).

Key features include:
-   Identify and integrate with batch/API-based historical data providers (e.g., Polygon.io, Alpha Vantage, or bulk downloads from selected exchanges/vendors).
-   Develop scripts/ETL processes for fetching historical data for a defined list of equity symbols.
-   Handle data parsing, normalization (e.g., adjusting for splits, dividends), and validation.
-   Store processed historical data in `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB` in an optimized format for querying (e.g., by symbol, date range, granularity).
-   Implement mechanisms for backfilling data for new symbols or correcting historical data errors.
-   Schedule regular updates to append new historical data as it becomes available (e.g., end-of-day processes for daily bars).
-   Robust error handling, logging, and monitoring for the ingestion process.
-   Documentation of the historical data schema and coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Historical Data Provider Integration:** The system successfully connects to and fetches data from the chosen historical data provider(s) API or batch files.
2.  **AC2: Comprehensive Data Coverage:** Historical OHLCV data (daily, hourly, minute - as specified) is ingested for a defined universe of symbols (e.g., S&P 500, Russell 3000) for a specified historical depth (e.g., 20 years for daily, 2 years for minute).
3.  **AC3: Data Accuracy & Adjustments:** Ingested historical data is validated for common errors and adjusted for corporate actions like stock splits and dividends to ensure price continuity.
4.  **AC4: Efficient Storage:** Historical data is stored in `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB` in a query-efficient manner, correctly indexed by symbol, timestamp, and granularity.
5.  **AC5: Backfill Capability:** A mechanism exists to backfill historical data for newly added symbols or to re-ingest data for specific periods/symbols if corrections are needed.
6.  **AC6: Scheduled Updates:** Automated processes are in place to append new historical data regularly (e.g., daily EOD updates).
7.  **AC7: Error Handling & Logging:** The ingestion process includes robust error handling, retries for transient issues, and detailed logging.
8.  **AC8: Data Accessibility:** Ingested historical data is accessible via the internal Data Access API Layer (defined in Story 6.9) for use by other services.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   Historical data ingestion pipeline for equities is operational.
-   Specified historical data coverage (symbols, depth, granularity) is achieved in `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`.
-   Data is adjusted for corporate actions and validated for basic accuracy.
-   Backfill and scheduled update mechanisms are functional.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and unit/integration tests passed.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) confirms historical data availability and accuracy for sample symbols and date ranges.

## AI Integration Details

-   **Crucial Dependency:** Historical data is the primary fuel for training many AI/ML models (e.g., predictive models, backtesting trading strategies developed by AI).
-   AI can be used in later stories (e.g., Story 6.8) for more advanced validation of historical data integrity and anomaly detection.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Not directly a UI story, but enables historical charting features for users.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 6: Data Sources & Market Integration](../epic-6.md)
-   `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB` setup and schema defined for historical OHLCV data.
-   API keys/access for historical data providers.
-   Story 6.9 (Design & Implement Internal Data Access API Layer) for making data accessible.
-   Clear definition of symbols, historical depth, and granularities required.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Selection of historical data provider(s) â€“ balancing cost, coverage, data quality, and API robustness.
-   Handling of data inconsistencies or errors from providers.
-   Volume of data and storage costs in `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`.
-   Complexity of accurately adjusting for all types of corporate actions across all symbols and history.
-   Performance of ingestion processes, especially for initial bulk loads.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Data Integrity:** Historical data must be accurate and complete as per source.
-   **Availability:** Historical data should be highly available once ingested.
-   **Performance:** Queries against historical data (e.g., for charting or AI model training) must be performant.
-   **Scalability:** Ingestion pipelines and storage should scale to accommodate more symbols, deeper history, and finer granularities over time.
