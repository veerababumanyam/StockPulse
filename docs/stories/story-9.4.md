**Epic:** Epic 9: Data Analytics & Business Intelligence - Backend AI Data Pipelines & KB Management
**Story ID:** 9.4
**Story Title:** Alternative Financial Data Ingestion & Analysis Pipeline
**Assigned to:** Data Engineering Team, AI Research Team, Quantitative Analysis Team  
**Story Points:** 14

## Business Context
As a StockPulse AGI system, to gain a competitive edge and uncover non-obvious market signals, I need access to and the ability to analyze alternative financial data sources (e.g., social media sentiment, satellite imagery for supply chain monitoring, employee satisfaction reviews, app download statistics, web traffic data). As a data engineer, I need to build versatile pipelines to ingest, process, and extract insights from these diverse and often unstructured datasets, integrating them into our AGI's knowledge base.

## User Story
**As a** data engineer  
**I want to** develop pipelines for ingesting and analyzing various alternative financial data sources  
**So that** AGI agents can leverage these unique, often real-time, datasets to enhance market predictions, identify emerging trends, assess company performance, and gain deeper contextual understanding beyond traditional financial metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Diverse Alternative Data Source Ingestion
- Ability to ingest data from at least two distinct types of alternative data sources (e.g., social media APIs like Twitter/Reddit, geospatial data providers, web scraping for product reviews/job postings, app analytics platforms).

- Handling of various data formats (JSON, XML, CSV, image files, unstructured text).
- Robust connectors and adapters for different alternative data providers.
- Scalable ingestion infrastructure to handle high-volume, real-time streams from some sources.
- Metadata tagging for all ingested alternative data (source, timestamp, collection parameters, data rights).

### 2. Pre-processing & Feature Engineering for Alternative Data
- Specialized pre-processing tailored to the specific alternative data type (e.g., text cleaning and normalization for social media, image processing for satellite data, time-series resampling for sensor data).
- Feature engineering to extract meaningful signals (e.g., sentiment scores, topic modeling from text; object detection or change detection from imagery; anomaly detection from sensor data).
- Geolocation data processing and linking to company assets or supply chains.
- User-generated content analysis (e.g., identifying key themes in product reviews, tracking brand perception).
- Normalization and standardization of extracted features for downstream consumption by AI models.
- Techniques for handling noisy, incomplete, or biased alternative data.

### 3. Insight Extraction & Signal Generation (AI/ML based)

- Correlation analysis between alternative data signals and traditional financial metrics (e.g., stock price, sales figures).
- Backtesting infrastructure to evaluate the predictive power of alternative data signals.
- Development of composite indicators by combining signals from multiple alternative data sources.
- Anomaly detection in alternative data streams that may indicate significant real-world events.
