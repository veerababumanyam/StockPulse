# Story 1.1: Implement User Registration Flow

**Epic:** [Core User Authentication and Account Setup](../epic-1.md)
**Status:** Draft
**Priority:** High
**Points:** (Estimate)
**Assigned To:**
**Sprint:**

## 1. User Story

> As a new user,
> I want to be able to register for a StockPulse account using my email and a password,
> So that I can access the platform.

## 2. Requirements

*   Provide a user registration form accessible via a dedicated route (e.g., `/register`).
*   The form must collect:
    *   Email address
    *   Password
    *   Password confirmation
*   Implement client-side validation for:
    *   Email format (must be a valid email structure).
    *   Password strength (e.g., minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one number, one special character - specific rules TBD or from a general policy).
    *   Password confirmation must match the password.
*   On form submission, securely transmit user credentials to the backend registration API endpoint.
*   **AI-Assisted Fraud Check:** Before final account creation (or in parallel), registration data (e.g., email, IP address) should be sent to the AI Fraud Detection Agent for risk assessment. The outcome of this check might influence the registration flow (e.g., require additional verification, or flag the account).
*   Upon successful registration (as indicated by the backend API and passing any fraud checks):
    *   Redirect the user to a "Registration Successful" confirmation page or directly to the login page.
*   Display clear, user-friendly error messages for:
    *   Client-side validation failures.
    *   API-side errors (e.g., email already exists, server error).
*   Input fields for passwords should obscure the entered text.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  **AC1:** Given a user is on the registration page (`/register`), when they enter a valid email, a strong password (meeting defined criteria), and a matching password confirmation, and submit the form, then the system invokes the AI Fraud Detection Agent, and if the risk is acceptable, the account is successfully created via the backend API, and the user is redirected to the login page (or a success confirmation page).
2.  **AC2:** Given a user is on the registration page, when they attempt to submit the form with an invalid email format, then a client-side validation error message is displayed for the email field, and the form is not submitted.
3.  **AC3:** Given a user is on the registration page, when they attempt to submit the form with a password that does not meet the defined strength criteria, then a client-side validation error message is displayed for the password field, and the form is not submitted.
4.  **AC4:** Given a user is on the registration page, when they attempt to submit the form with a password confirmation that does not match the password, then a client-side validation error message is displayed for the password confirmation field, and the form is not submitted.
5.  **AC5:** Given a user attempts to register with an email that already exists in the system, when the form is submitted, then an appropriate error message (e.g., "Email already in use. Please login or use a different email.") is displayed, sourced from the backend API response.
6.  **AC6:** Given a user is on the registration page, all password input fields must obscure the characters as they are typed.
7.  **AC7:** Given any server-side error occurs during the registration API call (other than email already exists), then a generic but user-friendly error message (e.g., "Registration failed. Please try again later.") is displayed.
8.  **AC8 (New):** Given the AI Fraud Detection Agent flags a registration attempt as high-risk, then the registration may be blocked, or the user may be presented with an additional verification step (specific behavior TBD by policy defined in Story 1.4).

## 4. Technical Guidance for Developer Agent

*   **Relevant PRD Sections:**
    *   `PRD.md#3.5.1` (Dashboard - auth is prerequisite)
    *   `PRD.md#4.3` (Security Requirements - Authentication)
    *   `PRD.md#5.1` (Beginner Trader - needs account)
*   **Relevant Architecture Sections:**
    *   `architecture.md#3.1.1` (Frontend Architecture - general structure)
    *   `architecture.md#3.1.2` (State Management - Zustand, React Query)
    *   `architecture.md#5.1` (Authentication & Authorization - JWT-based auth general concept)
    *   `architecture.md#5.AI` (Placeholder for AI Agent details, to be expanded - this assumes we will add a section about the Fraud Agent there)
    *   `docs/infrastructure_design.md#5.2` (AI Agent Architecture - Fraud Detection Agent)
*   **Key Components/Modules to be affected/created:**
    *   New Page: `src/pages/auth/RegisterPage.tsx`
    *   Router update: Add route for `/register` in `src/App.tsx` or router configuration file.
    *   New Components: Potentially `src/components/auth/RegistrationForm.tsx`, reusable input components in `src/components/ui/` if not already existing.
    *   Service: `src/services/authService.ts` to include a `registerUser` function, which will internally coordinate with the AI Fraud Detection Agent and the main registration endpoint.
    *   (Potentially) Service: `src/services/aiAgentService.ts` or similar, to handle communication with various AI agents, including the Fraud Detection Agent.
*   **API Endpoints Involved:**
    *   `POST /api/v1/auth/register` (Backend to confirm exact path and payload structure)
    *   `POST /api/v1/agents/fraud-detection/assess-registration` (Example endpoint for AI Fraud Agent - to be defined in Story 1.4)
        *   Expected Request Body: `{ "email": "user@example.com", "ipAddress": "x.x.x.x", "userAgent": "Browser Info" }`
        *   Expected Response: `{ "riskScore": 0.85, "assessment": "high-risk", "reason": "Disposable email detected" }`
*   **Data Models Involved:**
    *   User data model (primarily backend, but frontend might receive a user object on success). See `architecture.md#3.3.1` (PostgreSQL Users table for backend reference).
*   **Styling/UI Notes:**
    *   Refer to `StockPulse_Design.md` for overall look and feel, form styling, button styles, and error message presentation.
    *   Use existing UI components from `src/components/ui/` as much as possible (e.g., for buttons, input fields, layout).
    *   Ensure responsive design for the registration form.
*   **Error Handling Notes:**
    *   Implement comprehensive client-side validation before API calls.
    *   Handle API responses gracefully, mapping error codes/messages from backend to user-friendly frontend messages.
    *   Use a consistent method for displaying errors (e.g., inline with form fields, summary notification).
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   Ensure passwords are not stored in frontend state unencrypted for longer than necessary.
    *   All communication with the backend API must be over HTTPS.
    *   Input sanitization (though primarily a backend concern for a robust system, be mindful of any data displayed back to the user).
*   **Other Notes:**
    *   Password strength rules need to be finalized (e.g., refer to a global security policy document if it exists, or define based on best practices). For now, assume: min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, 1 special character.

## 5. Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **Task 1 (AC1, AC6):** Create `RegisterPage.tsx` and `RegistrationForm.tsx` component structure.
    *   Add basic form fields (email, password, confirm password).
    *   Ensure password fields obscure text.
2.  **Task 2 (AC2, AC3, AC4):** Implement client-side validation logic for all form fields.
    *   Email format validation.
    *   Password strength validation.
    *   Password confirmation matching.
    *   Display validation error messages.
3.  **Task 3 (AC1, AC5, AC7, AC8):** Enhance `authService.ts` `registerUser` function:
    *   Collect necessary data for fraud check (e.g., IP address if possible from frontend/backend context).
    *   Call the AI Fraud Detection Agent.
    *   Based on agent's response, proceed with actual registration or handle high-risk scenarios.
    *   Call the backend registration API.
    *   Handle request construction & API responses.
4.  **Task 4 (AC1):** Integrate updated API call into `RegistrationForm.tsx` submission handler.
    *   On successful registration, redirect user to login page (or success page).
5.  **Task 5 (AC1, AC5, AC7):** Implement display of API-sourced error messages on the form.
6.  **Task 6 (N/A):** Add routing for `/register` in the main application router.
7.  **Task 7 (N/A):** Write unit tests for validation logic and component rendering.
8.  **Task 8 (N/A):** Style the registration page and form according to `StockPulse_Design.md` using Tailwind CSS and existing UI components.

## 6. Definition of Done (DoD)

*   All Acceptance Criteria (AC1-AC8) are met and verified.
*   Code implemented, reviewed (e.g., by another agent or peer), and merged to the appropriate branch.
*   Unit tests written for new logic (e.g., validation functions, service calls) and components, achieving >80% coverage for new code.
*   Frontend is integrated with a functional (even if mock initially) backend registration endpoint.
*   The registration page is responsive and aligns with the design specifications in `StockPulse_Design.md`.
*   No console errors or critical warnings in the browser during operation.
*   Story demoed to PO/stakeholders (if applicable).

## 7. Notes / Questions

*   Confirm specific password strength rules if they differ from the assumed ones.
*   Exact backend API endpoint (`/api/v1/auth/register`) and payload/response structure needs final confirmation from the backend team.
*   Decision on redirection target post-successful registration (login page vs. dedicated success page). For now, assume login page.

## 8. Design / UI Mockup Links (If Applicable)

*   Refer to `docs/StockPulse_Design.md` for general auth screen layouts, form styling, button design, and color palettes. Specific mockups for Registration page to be located in section X.Y (TBD).
