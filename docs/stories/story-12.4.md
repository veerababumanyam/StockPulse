# Story 12.4: Create Autonomous Skill Development Framework

**Epic:** 12 - AGI Learning System - Continuous Learning & Adaptation

**User Story:** As an AI system, I need to identify my capability gaps and autonomously develop new skills to better serve users and handle edge cases.

**Status:** To Do

## Business Context:
This story implements an autonomous skill development framework that enables AI agents to continuously assess their capabilities, identify areas where they lack sufficient expertise, and automatically develop new skills to address these gaps. This self-improving capability is essential for AGI-level performance, allowing agents to evolve beyond their initial programming to meet emerging user needs and market conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Capability Gap Analysis:**
   - Automated assessment of current agent capabilities compared to required performance standards
   - Pattern recognition identifying recurring scenarios where agents perform suboptimally
   - User feedback analysis highlighting areas where agent responses are inadequate
   - Market evolution monitoring detecting new domains requiring agent expertise

2. **Skill Requirements Definition:**
   - Automatic generation of skill specifications based on identified capability gaps
   - Learning objective setting with measurable success criteria and performance targets
   - Resource requirement estimation for skill development including computational needs
   - Timeline planning for skill acquisition with milestone tracking

3. **Autonomous Learning Path Generation:**
   - Curriculum generation creating structured learning progressions for new skills
   - Learning resource identification and curation for skill development
   - Practice scenario creation enabling agents to develop skills through simulation
   - Knowledge source integration incorporating relevant training data and expertise

4. **Self-Directed Skill Acquisition:**
   - Autonomous execution of learning plans without human intervention
   - Active learning mechanisms seeking out relevant experiences and training opportunities
   - Experimentation and hypothesis testing for skill development validation
   - Progress monitoring and learning plan adjustment based on intermediate results

5. **Skill Integration and Deployment:**
   - Seamless integration of newly acquired skills into existing agent capabilities
   - Testing and validation ensuring new skills don't interfere with existing functions
   - Gradual deployment mechanisms rolling out new skills with safety monitoring
   - Performance measurement confirming skill development objectives are met

6. **Skill Sharing and Knowledge Transfer:**
   - Knowledge sharing mechanisms enabling skill transfer between agents
   - Best practice extraction from successful skill development efforts
   - Collective skill building where multiple agents contribute to skill development
   - Version control and skill management across the agent ecosystem

## Technical Guidance:

### Backend Architecture:
- **Framework:** Python with meta-learning libraries (MAML, Reptile) and automated curriculum generation
