# Story 11.2: Develop Cognitive Memory Architecture

**Epic:** 11 - AGI Foundation - Cognitive Architecture & Reasoning Engine

**User Story:** As a trading platform user, I want AI agents that remember my preferences, trading patterns, and market insights across sessions, so I receive increasingly personalized and contextual assistance over time.

**Status:** To Do

## Business Context:
This story implements foundational memory systems that enable AI agents to maintain context, learn from experiences, and build long-term understanding of users and markets. This cognitive memory architecture is essential for AGI development and provides immediate value through improved personalization and contextual awareness.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Multi-Layered Memory System:**
   - **Working Memory:** Active context for current trading session and immediate tasks
   - **Episodic Memory:** Specific trading events, decisions, and outcomes with temporal context
   - **Semantic Memory:** General knowledge about markets, user preferences, and trading concepts
   - **Procedural Memory:** Learned patterns for decision-making processes and trading workflows

2. **User Context Persistence:**
   - Long-term storage of user trading patterns, risk tolerance, and strategy preferences
   - Session continuity allowing agents to resume conversations and analyses
   - Preference learning that adapts to user behavior without explicit configuration
   - Cross-device context synchronization for seamless user experience

3. **Market Memory Integration:**
   - Historical market condition memory with pattern recognition capabilities
   - Seasonal and cyclical pattern storage for improved market timing
   - Event-outcome correlation memory for learning from market reactions
   - Volatility and sentiment pattern recognition across different market phases

4. **Experience-Based Learning:**
   - Memory consolidation processes that strengthen important information
   - Forgetting mechanisms that allow less relevant information to fade appropriately
   - Pattern extraction from episodic memories to build general knowledge
   - Success/failure correlation analysis to improve future recommendations

5. **Cross-Agent Memory Sharing:**
   - Shared semantic memory across all AI agents for consistent user understanding
   - Specialized episodic memories for each agent type (portfolio, trading, analysis)
   - Memory synchronization protocols ensuring all agents benefit from user interactions
   - Privacy-preserving memory sharing that maintains user data security

6. **Memory-Enhanced Decision Making:**
   - Context-aware recommendations based on historical user preferences
   - Learning from previous trading outcomes to improve future suggestions
   - Personalized risk assessment based on user's historical risk tolerance
   - Market timing improvements based on user's historical trading patterns

## Technical Guidance:

### Backend Architecture:
- **Framework:** Node.js/TypeScript with memory management systems
- **Memory Storage:** Hybrid approach using multiple databases optimized for different memory types
- **Working Memory:** `StockPulse_Redis` for fast access to current session data
- **Long-term Memory:** `StockPulse_PostgreSQL` for structured user and market data
- **Associative Memory:** `StockPulse_VectorDB` for pattern-based memory retrieval
- **Agent Design:** Adhere to principles in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` for agent-specific configurations (LLM parameters, memory, tools).

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/memory/store` - Store new memory (episodic, semantic, or procedural)
- `GET /api/memory/retrieve/{context}` - Retrieve relevant memories for current context
- `POST /api/memory/consolidate` - Trigger memory consolidation process
- `GET /api/memory/user/{userId}/patterns` - Get learned user patterns and preferences
- `POST /api/memory/relate` - Create associations between memories

### Memory Data Models:
```typescript
interface CognitiveMemory {
  memoryId: string;
  memoryType: 'working' | 'episodic' | 'semantic' | 'procedural';
  userId: string;
  agentId?: string;
  content: MemoryContent;
  associations: string[];
  strength: number;
  lastAccessed: Date;
  createdAt: Date;
  tags: string[];
}

interface EpisodicMemory extends CognitiveMemory {
  memoryType: 'episodic';
  event: TradingEvent;
  context: MarketContext;
  outcome?: TradingOutcome;
  emotions?: UserEmotionalState;
}

interface SemanticMemory extends CognitiveMemory {
  memoryType: 'semantic';
  concept: string;
  relationships: ConceptRelationship[];
  confidence: number;
  sourceExperiences: string[];
}

interface ProceduralMemory extends CognitiveMemory {
  memoryType: 'procedural';
  process: TradingProcess;
  conditions: TriggerCondition[];
  effectiveness: number;
  usageCount: number;
}
```

### Memory Consolidation Process:
- **Nightly Consolidation:** Batch processing to strengthen important memories
- **Real-time Updates:** Immediate updates for critical trading events
- **Pattern Extraction:** Machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in episodic memories
- **Memory Pruning:** Automated removal of outdated or conflicting memories
