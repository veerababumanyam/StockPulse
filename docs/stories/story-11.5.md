# Story 11.5: Create Meta-Reasoning and Self-Reflection Capabilities

**Epic:** 11 - AGI Foundation - Cognitive Architecture & Reasoning Engine

**User Story:** As an AI system, I need meta-reasoning capabilities to analyze and improve my own reasoning processes, enabling continuous self-optimization.

**Status:** To Do

## Business Context:
This story implements meta-reasoning capabilities that enable AI agents to think about their own thinking processes, analyze their reasoning quality, and autonomously improve their decision-making strategies. This self-reflective capability is crucial for AGI development and enables the system to become more sophisticated and effective over time.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Reasoning Process Monitoring:**
   - Real-time tracking of reasoning steps and decision pathways used by AI agents
   - Performance metrics collection for different reasoning strategies and approaches
   - Decision outcome correlation with reasoning process quality and complexity
   - Pattern identification in successful vs. unsuccessful reasoning chains

2. **Self-Analysis Framework:**
   - Automated evaluation of reasoning quality, consistency, and logical soundness
   - Detection of reasoning biases, circular logic, and logical fallacies
   - Analysis of reasoning efficiency and resource utilization patterns
   - Identification of gaps or weaknesses in current reasoning capabilities

3. **Strategy Optimization Engine:**
   - Autonomous adjustment of reasoning strategies based on performance feedback
   - A/B testing framework for comparing different reasoning approaches
   - Learning mechanisms that improve reasoning based on successful outcomes
   - Adaptation of reasoning complexity based on problem difficulty and context

4. **Confidence and Uncertainty Assessment:**
   - Self-assessment of confidence levels in reasoning conclusions
   - Uncertainty quantification and propagation through reasoning chains
   - Recognition of when additional information or different approaches are needed
   - Calibration of confidence levels with actual outcome accuracy

5. **Meta-Learning Capabilities:**
   - Learning how to learn more effectively from market data and user feedback
   - Optimization of knowledge acquisition and pattern recognition strategies
   - Development of reasoning heuristics that improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy
   - Transfer of successful reasoning patterns across different problem domains

6. **Self-Explanation Generation:**
   - Automated generation of explanations for how reasoning processes work
   - Metacognitive awareness of reasoning strengths and limitations
   - Documentation of reasoning improvement over time for transparency
   - Educational content helping users understand AI reasoning development
