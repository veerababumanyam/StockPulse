# Story 4.6: Implement AI-Powered Comparative Stock Analysis

**As an** investor (active trader or casual investor),
**I want** to select multiple stocks (e.g., 2-5) and receive an AI-generated comparative analysis of their key metrics, pros/cons, recent news sentiment, and analyst ratings summary,
**So that** I can make more informed decisions when choosing between potential investments.

## Description
This story focuses on providing users with a tool to directly compare a small set of stocks side-by-side, with AI-generated insights highlighting key differences and similarities. This helps users evaluate alternatives more effectively.

Key features include:
-   A UI allowing users to select 2 to (e.g.) 5 stocks for comparison. This might be initiated from a watchlist, search results, or a dedicated comparison tool page.
-   Display of key financial metrics for each selected stock in a side-by-side tabular format for easy comparison (e.g., Market Cap, P/E, EPS, Dividend Yield, Revenue Growth, Debt-to-Equity).
-   An AI-generated comparative summary that discusses:
    -   Overall strengths and weaknesses of each stock relative to the others in the selection.
    -   Comparison of recent news sentiment (e.g., which stock has more positive recent news).
    -   Summary of analyst ratings/ consensus for each stock.
    -   Potential suitability of each stock for different investment styles or goals (e.g., "Stock A might suit growth investors, while Stock B offers better dividends for income investors").
-   Clear presentation of both quantitative data and qualitative AI insights.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Stock Selection UI:** Users can select 2 to (e.g.,) 5 stocks for comparison through a clear interface.
2.  **AC2: Side-by-Side Metrics Display:** Key financial metrics for the selected stocks are displayed in a side-by-side table, allowing for easy visual comparison.
3.  **AC3: AI Comparative Summary:** An AI-generated textual summary is displayed, providing a comparative analysis of the selected stocks, covering relative strengths/weaknesses, news sentiment overview, and analyst rating summaries.
4.  **AC4: Clarity of AI Insights:** The AI summary is easy to understand, clearly attributes insights to AI, and avoids definitive investment advice (maintains an informational tone).
5.  **AC5: Data Accuracy:** All quantitative data presented (metrics) is accurate. AI summaries are factually based on the available data for the selected stocks.
6.  **AC6: Navigation:** Users can easily navigate from the comparison view to individual Stock Detail Pages (Story 4.2) for the compared stocks.
7.  **AC7: Performance:** The comparative analysis (both data and AI summary) is generated and displayed within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., < 10-15 seconds, depending on the number of stocks and complexity of AI analysis).
8.  **AC8: Error Handling:** If data for one or more stocks cannot be fetched, or if the AI summary generation fails, appropriate error messages are displayed without breaking the entire comparison view.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   Frontend UI for stock selection and display of comparative analysis (data tables + AI summary) is implemented.
-   Backend AI agent/service capable of fetching data for multiple stocks and generating the comparative AI summary is implemented.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and unit/integration tests passed.
-   AI models for analysis and generation are integrated.
-   Relevant data sources (`StockPulse_PostgreSQL`, `StockPulse_VectorDB`, news APIs, analyst rating sources) are integrated.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) has reviewed and approved the functionality.
-   The comparison tool is responsive and adheres to design guidelines.

## AI Integration Details

-   **Agent:** AI Market Insights Agent (or a specialized Comparative Analysis sub-agent).
-   **Tasks:**
    -   Fetch and aggregate financial metrics for the selected set of stocks.
    -   Fetch recent news and determine overall sentiment for each stock.
    -   Fetch analyst ratings/consensus for each stock.
    -   Utilize an LLM to synthesize this information into a coherent comparative textual summary, highlighting key differences, similarities, pros, and cons.
    -   Ensure the summary is balanced and avoids making direct investment recommendations.
-   **Models:** LLMs for text generation and synthesis.
-   **Data Sources:** `StockPulse_PostgreSQL` (fundamentals), `StockPulse_VectorDB` (news summaries, sentiment scores, analyst report summaries for RAG), external APIs for analyst ratings and potentially news.
-   **Flow:**
    1.  User selects multiple stocks for comparison.
    2.  Frontend sends the list of stock symbols to the backend AI agent/service.
    3.  Agent fetches all required data (metrics, news sentiment, analyst ratings) for each stock.
    4.  Agent provides this compiled data to an LLM with a prompt to generate a comparative analysis.
    5.  LLM generates the summary.
    6.  Agent returns the structured metric data and the AI-generated summary to the frontend.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Intuitive way to select stocks for comparison.
-   Clear, scannable side-by-side presentation of metrics.
-   Well-formatted and readable AI-generated summary.
-   Easy access to drill down into individual stock details.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 4: Stock Discovery & Analysis](../epic-4.md)
-   Stock Detail Page (Story 4.2) - for navigation.
-   Mechanism for selecting stocks (e.g., from watchlist, search results, or a dedicated input).
-   Backend infrastructure for AI Agents.
-   Access to relevant databases and APIs for metrics, news, and analyst ratings.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Defining the exact set of "key metrics" for side-by-side comparison.
-   Structuring the AI prompt effectively to yield balanced, insightful, and non-prescriptive comparisons.
-   Managing the complexity of fetching and processing data for multiple stocks simultaneously, impacting performance.
-   Ensuring consistency in the depth and tone of AI-generated comparative summaries.
-   Source and reliability of analyst rating summaries.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Performance:** As per AC7.
-   **Accuracy:** Comparative data and AI insights should be factually accurate based on underlying data.
-   **Objectivity:** AI summaries should strive for objectivity and clearly state if information is opinion-based (e.g., analyst ratings).
