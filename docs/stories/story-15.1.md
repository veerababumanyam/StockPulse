# Story 15.1: Implement Advanced A2A Coordination Protocol

**Epic:** 15 - AGI Orchestration & Multi-Agent Coordination

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I need a sophisticated communication protocol to coordinate complex tasks and share knowledge effectively with other AI agents.

**Status:** To Do

## Business Context:
This story implements an advanced Agent-to-Agent (A2A) coordination protocol that enables AI agents to collaborate on complex tasks, share knowledge efficiently, and achieve collective intelligence beyond individual agent capabilities. This sophisticated communication framework is crucial for AGI-level orchestration and multi-agent problem-solving in dynamic trading environments.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Semantic Communication Language:**
   - Standardized communication language with rich semantics for expressing complex concepts and intentions
   - Ontology-based knowledge representation ensuring shared understanding between agents
   - Multi-modal communication support for exchanging diverse types_of information (text, data, signals)
   - Context-aware communication adapting language and detail level to specific interactions

2. **Dynamic Task Decomposition and Allocation:**
   - Automated task decomposition breaking down complex goals into manageable sub-tasks
   - Intelligent task allocation matching sub-tasks to agents with relevant capabilities
   - Negotiation protocols enabling agents to bid for tasks and agree on responsibilities
   - Dynamic re-allocation mechanisms adapting to changing agent availability and performance

3. **Collaborative Knowledge Sharing:**
   - Secure and efficient knowledge sharing protocols for exchanging insights and experiences
   - Belief synchronization mechanisms maintaining consistent knowledge across collaborating agents
   - Distributed ledger technology for transparent and auditable knowledge sharing
   - Privacy-preserving techniques ensuring sensitive information is protected during sharing

4. **Multi-Agent Planning and Execution:**
   - Distributed planning algorithms enabling agents to create coordinated action plans
   - Real-time plan synchronization and adaptation during execution
   - Conflict resolution mechanisms managing disagreements and ensuring plan coherence
   - Performance monitoring for collaborative tasks tracking progress and identifying bottlenecks

5. **Swarm Intelligence Capabilities:**
   - Emergent behavior support enabling collective intelligence from simple agent interactions
   - Self-organizing agent networks adapting to changing tasks and environments
   - Decentralized control mechanisms reducing reliance on central orchestrators
   - Resilience and fault tolerance through distributed agent collaboration

6. **A2A Protocol Security and Trust:**
   - Secure communication channels protecting against eavesdropping and tampering
   - Agent authentication and authorization mechanisms verifying identities and permissions
   - Reputation systems tracking agent reliability and trustworthiness
   - Attack detection and mitigation preventing malicious agent behavior

## Technical Guidance:

### Backend Architecture:
- **Framework:** Python with multi-agent systems libraries (MASLite, JADE) and communication protocols (MQTT, gRPC)
- **Ontology Management:** Semantic web technologies (RDF, OWL) for knowledge representation
- **Distributed Coordination:** Consensus algorithms (Raft, Paxos) for distributed decision-making
- **Security Infrastructure:** PKI and encryption libraries for secure A2A communication

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/a2a/communicate` - Send messages and knowledge between AI agents
- `POST /api/a2a/coordinate` - Initiate collaborative tasks and planning sessions
- `GET /api/a2a/status` - Monitor A2A communication channels and agent interactions
- `POST /api/a2a/register` - Register new agents and their capabilities with the A2A network
- `GET /api/a2a/knowledge` - Query and retrieve shared knowledge from the A2A network

### Data Models:
```typescript
interface A2AMessage {
  messageId: string;
  senderAgentId: string;
  receiverAgentId: string;
  messageType: 'request' | 'inform' | 'query' | 'propose' | 'commit' | 'reject';
  payload: any; // Semantic content based on ontology
  timestamp: Date;
  priority: number;
  securityContext: SecurityContext;
}

interface CoordinatedTask {
  taskId: string;
  goal: string;
  decomposedSubTasks: SubTask[];
  assignedAgents: AgentAssignment[];
  coordinationPlan: CoordinationPlan;
  status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  progressMetrics: ProgressMetrics;
  sharedKnowledge: SharedKnowledgeReference[];
}

interface AgentReputation {
  agentId: string;
  reliabilityScore: number;
  cooperationIndex: number;
  taskCompletionRate: number;
  knowledgeContribution: number;
  lastUpdated: Date;
  interactionHistory: InteractionSummary[];
}
```

### Integration with Existing Systems:
- Enables advanced collaboration between all AI agents in the platform
- Integrates with AGI Meta-Agent (Story 7.7) for high-level orchestration
- Utilizes Hierarchical Memory (Epic 14) for shared knowledge storage
- **Agent Design:** The A2A coordination protocol is a fundamental component of how agents interact and collaborate, as detailed in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`.
