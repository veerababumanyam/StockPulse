# Story 14.7: Memory Security, Privacy & Ethical Governance for AGI

**Epic:** Epic 14: AGI Context & Memory Systems
**Story ID:** 14.7
**Story Title:** Memory Security, Privacy & Ethical Governance for AGI
**Assigned to:** Security Team, Ethics Committee, Legal Team, Development Team  
**Story Points:** 12

## Business Context
As a StockPulse platform operator, I need robust security, privacy protections, and ethical governance frameworks specifically for AGI memory systems. This is crucial to protect sensitive information stored and processed by AGI (including financial data, user interactions, and learned knowledge), prevent unauthorized access or tampering, ensure compliance with privacy regulations, and maintain ethical oversight over how AGI uses its memory. ([Source: User stories with examples and a template, Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories))

## User Story
**As a** platform operator  
**I want to** implement comprehensive security, privacy, and ethical governance for all AGI memory systems  
**So that** sensitive information within AGI memory is protected, user privacy is respected, regulatory requirements are met, and the AGI's use of its memory aligns with our ethical principles, thereby fostering trust and responsible AGI operation.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Secure Memory Infrastructure & Access Control
- End-to-end encryption for all AGI memory content, both at rest (in databases like KG, episodic stores) and in transit (between AGI components).
- Granular, role-based access control (RBAC) for AGI agents and human operators to different parts of the memory systems (KG, episodic, procedural, working memory logs).
- Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for all memory access APIs.
- Protection against common database vulnerabilities and unauthorized access attempts (e.g., SQL injection, graph traversal exploits if applicable).
- Regular security audits and penetration testing of memory infrastructure.
- Secure key management for encryption and decryption processes.

### 2. Privacy-Preserving Memory Techniques
- Implementation of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) where appropriate, such as differential privacy for aggregated memory analysis or federated learning for skill acquisition without centralizing raw episodic data.
- Anonymization or pseudonymization of personally identifiable information (PII) stored in episodic memory or KG, especially related to user interactions.
- Data minimization principles applied to memory storage â€“ only necessary information is retained.
- Mechanisms for users to control their data stored in AGI memory, including rights to access, rectify, and request erasure (subject to technical feasibility and legal constraints).
- Privacy impact assessments (PIAs) conducted for AGI memory systems.
- Compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

### 3. Ethical Governance of Memory Content & Usage
- Policies and procedures for the ethical use of AGI memory, including what types of information can be stored, how it can be used for learning and decision-making, and retention periods.
- Oversight by the Ethics Committee (Epic 13) on the content and application of AGI memory, particularly for sensitive or potentially biased information.
- Mechanisms to detect and mitigate biases that may be learned or reinforced through memory systems (linking to Story 13.2).
- Audit trails for how AGI memory is accessed, modified, and utilized in decision-making (linking to Story 13.5).
- Guidelines on an AGI's "right to forget" or have certain memories pruned, especially if they are harmful, outdated, or unethical.
- Framework for addressing conflicts if different AGI agents have contradictory or ethically problematic memories.

### 4. Protection Against Memory Tampering & Adversarial Attacks
- Immutable logging or blockchain-based solutions for critical memory components to ensure tamper evidence.
- Detection systems for identifying and alerting on suspicious memory access patterns or modification attempts.
- Robust validation and verification of new knowledge or experiences before they are committed to long-term memory, preventing data poisoning.
- Resilience of memory retrieval mechanisms against adversarial inputs designed to extract sensitive information or manipulate AGI behavior.
- Secure backup and recovery procedures for AGI memory systems, ensuring data integrity.
- Sandboxing or isolated memory spaces for AGI agents dealing with untrusted data sources.

### 5. Transparency & Explainability of Memory Operations
- Tools and interfaces for authorized personnel to inspect and understand the contents and structure of AGI memory (linking to XAI in Story 13.6).
- Ability to trace how specific memories influenced an AGI decision or learning process.
- Clear documentation on memory architecture, data flow, security protocols, and privacy safeguards.
- Reporting mechanisms for memory security incidents, privacy breaches, or ethical violations related to memory usage.
- User-facing explanations (where appropriate) about how their data contributes to AGI memory and learning, and how their privacy is protected.
- Regular reviews of memory governance policies to ensure they remain effective and aligned with evolving standards.

### 6. Compliance & Auditing for Memory Systems
- Automated checks and regular internal/external audits to ensure AGI memory systems comply with security policies, privacy regulations, and ethical guidelines.
- Generation of compliance reports for regulatory bodies or internal oversight.
- Processes for addressing non-compliance issues identified during audits.
- Secure retention and disposal policies for different types of AGI memory data.
- Training for developers and operators on secure and ethical memory management practices.
- Designation of data protection officers or roles responsible for AGI memory governance.
