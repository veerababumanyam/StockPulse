# Story 6.7: Develop Data Ingestion Pipelines for Key Data Types with Monitoring

**As a** system (StockPulse backend infrastructure),
**I need** robust, observable, and manageable data ingestion pipelines for all key integrated data types (real-time market data, historical data, fundamentals, news),
**So that** data flows reliably from external sources into our internal databases, data quality can be maintained, and operational issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

## Description
This story focuses on the design, implementation, and operationalization of the data ingestion pipelines themselves, building upon the specific integrations defined in stories 6.1-6.6. It emphasizes the common infrastructure, scheduling, monitoring, and management aspects of these pipelines.

Key features include:
-   Design a common framework or pattern for data ingestion pipelines (e.g., using tools like Apache Airflow, Prefect, or custom-built schedulers and workers).
-   Implement specific ETL/ELT logic for each data type, encapsulating the fetching, transformation (normalization, validation), and loading steps defined in previous stories (6.1-6.6).
-   Integrate comprehensive logging for all pipeline stages (e.g., data fetched, records processed, errors encountered, data loaded).
-   Implement robust error handling within pipelines, including retries for transient failures and dead-letter queues or alerting for persistent issues.
-   Develop and integrate monitoring dashboards (e.g., using Grafana, Prometheus, or cloud provider tools) to track:
    *   Pipeline status (running, success, failed).
    *   Data volume processed.
    *   Error rates and types.
    *   Latency of data ingestion.
    *   Resource utilization of pipeline components.
-   Implement alerting mechanisms for pipeline failures or significant data anomalies detected during ingestion.
-   Ensure pipelines are configurable (e.g., source API keys, scheduling parameters, symbol lists).
-   Develop documentation for operating and troubleshooting the data ingestion pipelines.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Pipeline Framework Implemented:** A common framework or standardized approach for data ingestion pipelines is established and used for key data types.
2.  **AC2: End-to-End Pipeline Operation:** Data ingestion pipelines for real-time market data, historical data, fundamentals, and news are operating end-to-end, from source to target database.
3.  **AC3: Comprehensive Logging:** All pipeline runs and significant events within them are logged with sufficient detail for diagnostics.
4.  **AC4: Robust Error Handling:** Pipelines incorporate error handling, retry mechanisms for transient issues, and clear failure reporting for non-recoverable errors.
5.  **AC5: Monitoring & Dashboards:** Monitoring dashboards are in place, providing visibility into pipeline health, data volumes, error rates, and latency.
6.  **AC6: Alerting System:** An alerting system is configured to notify the Data Engineering team of pipeline failures or critical data issues during ingestion.
7.  **AC7: Configurability:** Pipeline parameters (e.g., API keys, schedules, target databases) are configurable without code changes.
8.  **AC8: Operational Documentation:** Basic operational documentation for the pipelines is created (e.g., how to run, monitor, common troubleshooting steps).

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   Data ingestion pipelines for key data sources are implemented, monitored, and manageable.
-   Logging, error handling, and alerting are functional.
-   Operational documentation is available.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and unit/integration tests passed for pipeline components.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) and Data Engineering Lead confirm pipelines are robust and observable.

## AI Integration Details

-   AI can be a *consumer* of the monitoring data, e.g., an AI agent could be trained to predict pipeline failures or optimize resource allocation for pipelines (future scope).
-   AI-driven anomaly detection can be integrated into the pipelines as part of data validation (see Story 6.8).

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Not directly a UI story, but operational dashboards will have a UI for the Data Engineering team.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 6: Data Sources & Market Integration](../epic-6.md)
-   Completed individual data source integration stories (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6) as these define the core ETL logic.
-   Monitoring and alerting infrastructure (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager).
-   Logging infrastructure (e.g., ELK stack, CloudWatch Logs).
-   Scheduling tools (e.g., Airflow, cron).

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Selection of pipeline orchestration and monitoring tools.
-   Complexity of building a truly generic pipeline framework versus specific, optimized pipelines for each data type.
-   Ensuring monitoring and alerting are comprehensive enough without being overly noisy.
-   Defining appropriate SLOs/SLIs for data ingestion pipelines.
-   Resource management for running multiple, potentially heavy, ingestion pipelines.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Reliability:** Pipelines must be highly reliable and fault-tolerant.
-   **Maintainability:** Pipeline code and configurations should be easy to understand and maintain.
-   **Scalability:** Pipelines should be designed to handle increasing data volumes and more sources over time.
-   **Observability:** Pipeline operations must be highly observable through logs, metrics, and traces.
