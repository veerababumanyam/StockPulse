# Story 14.4: Episodic & Autobiographical Memory System for AGI

**Epic:** Epic 14: AGI Context & Memory Systems
**Story ID:** 14.4
**Story Title:** Episodic & Autobiographical Memory System for AGI
**Assigned to:** AI Research Team, Development Team  
**Story Points:** 14

## Business Context
As an AGI developer, I need to implement a robust episodic and autobiographical memory system that allows AGI agents to store, retrieve, and reflect upon their specific past experiences, including sequences of events, sensory details, and associated emotional or contextual states. This is fundamental for learning from past interactions, understanding causality, developing a sense of self, and personalizing interactions.

## User Story
**As an** AGI developer  
**I want to** build an episodic and autobiographical memory system for AGI agents  
**So that** they can recall and learn from their unique past experiences, understand temporal sequences of events, and develop a more coherent and personalized understanding of their interactions and the world.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Rich Event Encoding & Storage
- Ability to capture and store detailed records of AGI experiences (episodes), including sensory inputs, agent actions, internal states (e.g., goals, predictions, confidence levels), environmental context, and outcomes.
- Temporal tagging of all episodic memories with high-precision timestamps.
- Storage of event sequences, maintaining the order and duration of constituent parts of an episode.
- Mechanisms for linking episodes to semantic knowledge in the KG (Story 14.1) (e.g., entities involved, concepts activated).
- Efficient storage and indexing of a large volume of episodic data.
- Support for multi-modal episodic memories (e.g., recording visual input alongside decision logs).

### 2. Contextualized Episodic Retrieval
- Retrieval of specific episodes based on various cues (e.g., time, location, entities involved, emotional state, similarity to current situation).
- Ability to retrieve sequences of related episodes to reconstruct past event chains.
- Context-sensitive retrieval that prioritizes memories relevant to the AGI's current task or query.
- Support for partial matching and fuzzy querying of episodic memory.
- "Flashbulb" memory capabilities for highly salient or surprising events.
- APIs for AGI agents to query their own autobiographical memory using natural language or structured queries.

### 3. Memory Consolidation & Abstraction
- Processes for consolidating important episodic memories into more permanent storage, potentially abstracting gist or key learnings.
- Mechanisms for forgetting or down-weighting trivial or redundant episodes to manage memory capacity.
- Extraction of common patterns or schemas from multiple similar episodes (e.g., learning the typical script for a type of financial transaction).
- Integration with semantic memory (Story 14.1) where consolidated episodic knowledge contributes to general understanding.
- Sleep-like or offline processing for memory consolidation and reorganization.
- Control over consolidation parameters (e.g., what makes an episode "important" enough to consolidate).

### 4. Autobiographical Reasoning & Reflection
- AGI ability to reflect on its past experiences to draw conclusions, learn lessons, or adjust future behavior.
- Support for counterfactual reasoning about past episodes ("What if I had acted differently?").
- Mechanisms for identifying causal relationships between actions and outcomes in past episodes.
- Use of autobiographical memory for self-assessment and performance monitoring.
- Ability to narrate or explain past experiences and the reasoning behind past actions.
- Linkage of autobiographical memory to the AGI's sense of identity or persistent self-model (if applicable).

### 5. Temporal Pattern Detection & Prediction
- Algorithms for detecting recurring temporal patterns and sequences within episodic memory.
- Use of past event sequences to predict future events or outcomes in similar contexts.
- Learning of causal links and dependencies from observing co-occurring events over time.
- Integration with reinforcement learning agents to use episodic recall for better credit assignment and planning (e.g., episodic RL).
- Visualization tools for exploring temporal patterns in AGI's life experience.
- Support for reasoning about timelines and event durations.

### 6. Privacy & Security of Personal Experiences
- Strict privacy controls for AGI autobiographical memories, especially if they involve interactions with users or sensitive data.
- Encryption of episodic memory content.
- Role-based access for developers or auditors to inspect AGI memories, with appropriate safeguards and logging.
- Mechanisms for users to manage or request deletion of AGI memories related to their interactions (if applicable and technically feasible).
- Compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) for any personal data captured in episodes.
- Anonymization or pseudonymization techniques for episodic data used in aggregate analysis or model training.
