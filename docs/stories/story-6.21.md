# Story 6.21: Implement Cross-Asset Correlation Dashboard with 3D Visualization

**Epic:** [Epic 6: Enhanced Data Sources & Cross-Asset Integration](../epic-6.md)

**Status:** To Do

**Priority:** High

**Estimated Effort:** 14 Story Points (3.5 weeks)

## User Story

**As a** portfolio manager or quantitative analyst
**I want** real-time cross-asset correlation analysis with interactive 3D visualizations and multi-market data integration
**So that** I can identify diversification opportunities, detect systemic risks, and understand relationships between stocks, crypto, commodities, and forex markets

## Description

Implement a comprehensive cross-asset correlation analysis module that provides real-time correlation matrices, scatter plots, and interactive 3D visualizations across multiple asset classes. This system integrates data from stocks, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and forex markets to help users understand market interconnections and identify portfolio optimization opportunities.

The module leverages AG-UI capabilities to dynamically generate optimal correlation visualizations based on market conditions and user analysis context, providing adaptive interfaces that highlight the most relevant cross-asset relationships.
