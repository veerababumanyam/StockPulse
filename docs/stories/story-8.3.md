# Story 8.3: Implement AI Portfolio Optimization & Rebalancing Advisor

**As a** user (investor or portfolio manager),
**I want** an AI-powered advisor that can analyze my current portfolio and suggest optimizations (e.g., based on Modern Portfolio Theory, target risk levels, or specific financial goals) and provide rebalancing recommendations when my portfolio drifts from its target allocation,
**So that** I can improve my portfolio's risk-return profile and stay aligned with my investment objectives.

## Description
This story focuses on providing users with actionable AI-driven advice on how to optimize their portfolio structure and maintain its desired allocation over time.

Key features include:
-   **Portfolio Optimization Engine:**
    *   Allow users to define investment goals (e.g., maximize Sharpe ratio, minimize volatility for a target return, target a specific risk score) or select from predefined risk profiles (linked to Story 7.3 settings).
    *   The "AI Portfolio Optimizer Agent" uses optimization algorithms (e.g., Mean-Variance Optimization, Black-Litterman) to suggest an optimal asset allocation based on historical data, expected returns (potentially AI-generated from Story 8.4), and covariance estimates.
    *   Present the suggested optimal portfolio alongside the current one, highlighting differences and expected benefits (e.g., improved Sharpe ratio, lower projected volatility).
-   **Rebalancing Advisor:**
    *   Monitor the user's portfolio for drift from its target asset allocation (either user-defined or the AI-suggested optimal).
    *   When drift exceeds a configurable threshold, the AI agent notifies the user and suggests specific trades (buys/sells) to rebalance the portfolio back to its target.
    *   Consider transaction costs and tax implications (basic considerations initially, advanced later).
-   **AI Integration - AI Portfolio Optimizer Agent:**
    *   Performs optimization calculations.
    *   Generates rebalancing proposals.
    *   May use AI to refine inputs to optimization models (e.g., expected returns, covariance matrices).
-   Clear UI to set optimization goals, view suggested allocations, and understand rebalancing trades.
-   Option to (eventually) link rebalancing trades to the order execution system (Epic 5).

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Goal-Based Optimization:** Users can set an investment goal (e.g., select a risk profile like "Conservative" or "Aggressive" or target a Sharpe ratio) and receive an AI-suggested optimal asset allocation for their existing holdings or a target amount.
2.  **AC2: Rebalancing Suggestions:** The system monitors portfolio drift against a target allocation and provides actionable rebalancing trade suggestions (specific assets and amounts to buy/sell) when drift exceeds a threshold.
3.  **AC3: AI Agent Integration:** The AI Portfolio Optimizer Agent performs the backend optimization and rebalancing calculations.
4.  **AC4: Clear Presentation:** Optimization results (current vs. suggested allocation, projected risk/return) and rebalancing trades are presented clearly in the UI.
5.  **AC5: Configurable Drift Threshold:** Users can set or adjust the drift percentage that triggers rebalancing alerts/suggestions (with a sensible default).

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   The AI Portfolio Optimization & Rebalancing Advisor is functional.
-   Users can receive and understand AI-driven optimization and rebalancing advice.
-   The AI Portfolio Optimizer Agent correctly performs the underlying calculations.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and relevant tests passed.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) has validated the tool's functionality and the clarity of its recommendations.

## AI Integration Details

-   **AI Portfolio Optimizer Agent:**
    *   Implements optimization algorithms (e.g., MVO, potentially robust optimizers).
    *   Estimates expected returns and covariances (potentially using ML techniques or inputs from Story 8.4).
    *   Calculates optimal trades for rebalancing, considering constraints.
    *   Requires access to portfolio holdings (Epic 3), market data (Epic 6), user goals/risk profiles (Story 7.3).

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Simplify complex optimization concepts for the average user.
-   Clearly explain the rationale behind suggestions.
-   Provide visual comparisons of current vs. suggested portfolios.
-   Make it easy to understand the proposed rebalancing trades.
-   Transparency regarding model assumptions is key.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 8: Advanced Analytics & Insights](../epic-8.md)
-   Story 8.2 (AI-Powered Portfolio Risk Analyzer) as risk metrics are key inputs/outputs.
-   Story 8.4 (AI Forecasting Engine) as a potential source for expected return inputs.
-   Epic 3 (Detailed Portfolio Management) for portfolio data.
-   Epic 6 (Data Sources & Market Integration) for market data.
-   Story 7.3 (Agent-Specific Settings) for user risk profiles/goals.
-   Story 7.7 (AI Meta-Agent/Orchestrator Backend).

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Sensitivity of optimization results to input parameters (especially expected returns).
-   Communicating that optimal portfolios are based on models and historical data, not guarantees of future performance.
-   Handling constraints (e.g., no short selling, asset class limits) in optimization.
-   Deciding on the sophistication of optimization models for initial release.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Accuracy:** Optimization should be mathematically sound based on chosen models.
-   **Performance:** Optimization calculations should be reasonably fast.
-   **Understandability:** Recommendations must be clear and actionable.
