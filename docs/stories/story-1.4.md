# Story 1.4: Develop AI-Powered Fraud Detection for Registration

**Epic:** [Core User Authentication and Account Setup](../epic-1.md)
**Status:** To Do
**Priority:** High
**Points:** (Estimate - likely 5 or 8 due to AI complexity)
**Assigned To:**
**Sprint:**

## 1. User Story

> As the platform operator,
> I want an AI agent to analyze new user registrations in real-time to identify and flag potentially fraudulent accounts,
> So that platform abuse is minimized, legitimate users are protected, and manual review efforts are reduced.

## 2. Requirements

*   **AI Agent Development:**
    *   Create a new "AI Fraud Detection Agent" service/module.
    *   This agent will receive registration attempt data (e.g., email, IP address, user-agent string).
    *   The agent must return a risk assessment (e.g., risk score, risk level: low/medium/high) and optionally reasons for its assessment.
*   **RAG Integration:**
    *   The AI Fraud Detection Agent must utilize a RAG pipeline.
    *   The RAG knowledge base (`StockPulse_VectorDB`) will store:
        *   Known fraud patterns (e.g., characteristics of fraudulent emails, IP ranges, velocity patterns).
        *   Lists of disposable email providers.
        *   Data from publicly available breach databases (if ethically and legally permissible and GDPR compliant).
        *   (Potentially) Historical anonymized registration data from StockPulse to learn internal patterns.
    *   The agent will use retrieved context from the RAG pipeline to inform its risk assessment.
*   **API Endpoint:**
    *   Expose an internal API endpoint for the AI Fraud Detection Agent (e.g., `POST /api/v1/agents/fraud-detection/assess-registration`).
*   **Integration with Registration Flow (Story 1.1):**
    *   The main user registration process (`authService.ts`) will call this AI agent.
    *   Based on the agent's response:
        *   **Low Risk:** Registration proceeds normally.
        *   **Medium Risk:** Registration might proceed but account is flagged for monitoring, or an additional verification step (e.g., email verification, CAPTCHA) is enforced.
        *   **High Risk:** Registration is blocked, or account is immediately sent for manual review. (Policy to be defined).
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Risk thresholds (for low/medium/high) should be configurable.
    *   Actions for each risk level should be configurable.
*   **Logging & Monitoring:**
    *   Log all fraud assessment requests and responses.
    *   Monitor agent performance and accuracy.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  **AC1:** Given a registration attempt with data indicative of low fraud risk (e.g., known good email provider, normal IP), when the AI Fraud Detection Agent assesses it, then it returns a "low" risk assessment.
2.  **AC2:** Given a registration attempt with data indicative of high fraud risk (e.g., disposable email, known malicious IP), when the AI Fraud Detection Agent assesses it, then it returns a "high" risk assessment with a corresponding reason (e.g., "Disposable email provider detected").
3.  **AC3:** Given the `authService.ts` receives a "low" risk assessment from the agent for a registration, then the registration process continues as normal (as defined in Story 1.1).
4.  **AC4:** Given the `authService.ts` receives a "high" risk assessment from the agent, then the registration is blocked, and an appropriate message is queued for the user (handled by Story 1.1). (Alternative: manual review flag is set).
5.  **AC5 (Medium Risk - Optional/Configurable):** Given the `authService.ts` receives a "medium" risk assessment, then an additional verification step is triggered (e.g., user is forced to verify email before login is allowed, or a CAPTCHA is presented â€“ exact mechanism TBD).
6.  **AC6:** The RAG pipeline for the fraud agent is functional, capable of ingesting fraud-related documents/data into `StockPulse_VectorDB` and retrieving relevant context for the agent.
7.  **AC7:** Risk thresholds and corresponding actions (block, flag, allow) are configurable.
8.  **AC8:** All interactions with the AI Fraud Detection Agent are logged, including input data, risk score, and reasons.

## 4. Technical Guidance for Developer Agent

*   **Relevant PRD Sections:** (To be defined - likely a new section on AI-driven security)
*   **Relevant Architecture Sections:**
    *   `docs/infrastructure_design.md#4.3` (StockPulse_VectorDB)
    *   `docs/infrastructure_design.md#5.1` (RAG Pipeline)
    *   `docs/infrastructure_design.md#5.2` (AI Agent Architecture - specifically Fraud Detection Agent)
*   **Key Components/Modules to be affected/created:**
    *   New AI Agent Service/Module: `src/services/ai/fraudDetectionAgent.ts` (or similar, could be a separate microservice if complex).
    *   RAG Pipeline components: Scripts for data ingestion, embedding, and retrieval logic.
    *   Updates to `src/services/authService.ts` (as detailed in Story 1.1).
    *   Configuration files for risk thresholds and actions.
*   **API Endpoints Involved:**
    *   `POST /api/v1/agents/fraud-detection/assess-registration`
        *   Request Body: `{ "email": "user@example.com", "ipAddress": "x.x.x.x", "userAgent": "Browser Info", "timestamp": "ISO_DATETIME" }`
        *   Response Body: `{ "riskScore": 0.05, "riskLevel": "low" | "medium" | "high", "reasons": ["Reason 1", "Reason 2"], "agentTraceId": "uuid" }`
*   **Data Models Involved:**
    *   Schema for storing fraud patterns/knowledge in `StockPulse_VectorDB`.
    *   Potentially a new table in `StockPulse_PostgreSQL` for flagged accounts or audit logs of fraud checks.
*   **Libraries/Frameworks:**
    *   LLM framework (e.g., LangChain, Semantic Kernel) for agent logic.
    *   Vector database client library (e.g., Weaviate client, Milvus client).
    *   Embedding model (e.g., Sentence Transformers from Hugging Face).
*   **Error Handling Notes:**
    *   Graceful handling if the Fraud Detection Agent is unavailable or errors out (e.g., default to a specific risk level or bypass with logging).
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   Protection of the fraud detection API endpoint.
    *   Secure handling of data passed to the agent.
    *   Ethical considerations regarding data sources for RAG.
*   **Other Notes:**
    *   This story focuses on the agent and its integration. The actual UI for additional verification steps (for medium risk) might be a separate linked story.
    *   The "knowledge base" for RAG needs to be curated and maintained.

## 5. Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **Task 1 (AC6):** Design and implement the RAG pipeline for fraud detection:
    *   Identify and curate initial knowledge sources (e.g., lists of disposable email domains).
    *   Develop scripts for ingesting and embedding this data into `StockPulse_VectorDB`.
2.  **Task 2 (AC1, AC2):** Develop the core logic for the `AIFraudDetectionAgent` service.
    *   Implement retrieval from RAG.
    *   Implement LLM interaction for risk assessment based on retrieved context and input data.
    *   Define logic for determining risk score and level.
3.  **Task 3 (N/A):** Create the API endpoint `/api/v1/agents/fraud-detection/assess-registration`.
4.  **Task 4 (AC3, AC4, AC5):** Integrate the call to the fraud detection agent within `authService.ts` (linking to Story 1.1's tasks). Define how to handle different risk levels.
5.  **Task 5 (AC7):** Implement configuration for risk thresholds and actions.
6.  **Task 6 (AC8):** Implement logging for all agent interactions and decisions.
7.  **Task 7 (N/A):** Write unit and integration tests for the AI agent, RAG pipeline, and API endpoint.

## 6. Definition of Done (DoD)

*   All Acceptance Criteria (AC1-AC8) met.
*   AI Fraud Detection Agent is functional and integrated into the registration flow.
*   RAG pipeline provides relevant context to the agent.
*   Risk assessments are logged and configurable.
*   Code reviewed, merged, tests passing.

## 7. Notes / Questions

*   What are the initial data sources for the RAG knowledge base?
*   What is the defined policy for handling "medium" risk assessments? (e.g., force email verification, CAPTCHA, flag for review).
*   How will the RAG knowledge base be kept up-to-date? (Manual process, automated feeds?).
*   What are the specific data points available from the frontend/backend context during registration to pass to the agent (e.g., can we reliably get IP, user-agent)?

## 8. Design / UI Mockup Links (If Applicable)

*   N/A for this agent-focused story directly, but outcomes might influence UI in Story 1.1.
