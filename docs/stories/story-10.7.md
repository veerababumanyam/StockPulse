# Story 10.7: Platform Backup, Restore & Disaster Recovery Strategy

**Epic:** Epic 10: Platform Administration & Observability
**Story ID:** 10.7
**Story Title:** Platform Backup, Restore & Disaster Recovery Strategy
**Assigned to:** DevOps Team, SRE Team, Security Team
**Story Points:** 12

## Business Context
As a StockPulse platform operator, I need a comprehensive backup, restore, and disaster recovery (DR) strategy for all critical platform components, including application data, user data, AGI models, knowledge graphs, and system configurations. This is essential to ensure business continuity, minimize data loss, and enable rapid recovery in the event of system failures, data corruption, cyberattacks, or natural disasters.

## User Story
**As a** platform operator
**I want to** implement a robust platform backup, restore, and disaster recovery strategy
**So that** I can ensure business continuity, protect against data loss, and quickly recover critical platform services in the event of any major outage or disaster, maintaining user trust and regulatory compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Comprehensive Backup Coverage
- Automated, regular backups scheduled for all critical data stores: relational databases, NoSQL databases, AGI Knowledge Graph (Story 14.1), AGI episodic memory (Story 14.4), object storage (for large files, AGI models), audit logs (Story 10.5), and system configurations (Story 10.6).
- Versioned backups for AGI models and their associated training data.
- Backup of critical infrastructure configurations (e.g., Kubernetes cluster state, network configurations).
- Off-site and/or geographically redundant storage of backups to protect against localized disasters.
- Encryption of backup data both in transit and at rest.
- Monitoring of backup job success/failure with alerting (Story 10.4).

### 2. Defined Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) & Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)
- RTO and RPO are defined and documented for different critical services and data types based on business impact analysis.
- The backup strategy (frequency, type) is designed to meet the defined RPOs.
- The restore procedures and infrastructure are designed to meet the defined RTOs.
- RTO/RPO targets are regularly reviewed and updated as business needs evolve.
- Different tiers of RTO/RPO may exist for different components (e.g., transactional data vs. analytical data).

### 3. Robust Data Restore Capabilities
- Well-documented and tested procedures for restoring data from backups for all critical systems.
- Ability to perform point-in-time recovery (PITR) for key databases where feasible.
- Selective restore capabilities (e.g., restoring a specific user's data or a particular AGI model version) where appropriate.
- Validation of data integrity and consistency after a restore operation.
- Tools and scripts to automate restore processes as much as possible.
- Secure access controls for performing restore operations.

### 4. Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan & Infrastructure
- A comprehensive DR plan outlining procedures for recovering the entire platform or critical services in a secondary DR site or cloud region.
- Choice of DR strategy (e.g., cold standby, warm standby, hot standby/multi-site active-active) based on RTO/RPO and cost.
- Replication of critical data and configurations to the DR site.
- Infrastructure provisioning (or Infrastructure-as-Code templates) for DR environment.
- Clear failover and failback procedures defined in the DR plan.
- Communication plan for internal teams and external stakeholders during a DR event.

### 5. Regular DR Testing & Drills
- Regular testing of restore procedures from backups to ensure they work correctly and meet RTOs (e.g., quarterly).
- Periodic DR drills (e.g., tabletop exercises, partial failover tests, full DR site failover tests - annually) to validate the DR plan and identify gaps.
- Post-drill analysis and updates to the DR plan based on lessons learned.
- Training for relevant personnel on their roles and responsibilities during a DR event.
- Documentation of all test and drill results.

### 6. Monitoring & Alerting for Backup/DR Systems
- Continuous monitoring of backup job status, backup storage capacity, and data replication to DR site.
- Alerts (Story 10.4) for backup failures, restore failures, replication issues, or DR site health problems.
- Dashboard (Story 10.3) displaying the health and status of backup and DR systems.
- Monitoring of RPO and RTO compliance during tests and actual recovery events.
- Automated checks for backup integrity and restorability.

## Technical Guidance

### Backend Implementation (Python/FastAPI) - (APIs for managing/monitoring Backup/DR, if custom)
```python
# API Endpoints (often managed by underlying cloud/DB provider tools, but custom oversight APIs possible)
POST /api/v1/admin/backups/schedule_job
GET /api/v1/admin/backups/status/{job_id}
POST /api/v1/admin/restore/trigger_restore
GET /api/v1/admin/dr/status
POST /api/v1/admin/dr/initiate_failover_test

# Key Functions
async def configure_database_backup_policy(db_instance_id, policy_config)
async def monitor_backup_job_completion_status(backup_service_api)
async def execute_data_restore_procedure(backup_id, target_instance_config)
async def check_dr_site_replication_lag(primary_site_metrics, dr_site_metrics)
async def automate_dr_failover_sequence_script(target_service_group)
```

### Frontend Implementation (TypeScript/React) - (Backup/DR Status section in Admin Portal)
```typescript
interface BackupDRStatusDashboard {
  backupJobHistory: BackupJobLog[];
  restoreTestLog: RestoreTestResult[];
  drReplicationStatus: DRSiteHealthMetrics;
  rtoRpoCompliance: RTO RPOReport;
  upcomingDRDrills: DRDrillScheduleEntry[];
}

interface BackupJobLog {
  jobId: string;
  serviceName: string;
  dataType: string;
  startTime: Date;
  endTime: Date;
  status: 'success' | 'failed' | 'in_progress';
  backupSize: string;
  storageLocation: string;
}

interface DRSiteHealthMetrics {
  siteName: string;
  lastReplicationSync: Date;
  replicationLagSeconds: number;
  overallStatus: 'healthy' | 'warning' | 'critical';
}
```

### AI Integration Components
- AI-powered prediction of potential data loss based on backup frequency and failure rates.
- ML models to optimize backup schedules based on data change rates and system load.
- AI-assisted anomaly detection in backup sizes or patterns that might indicate issues (e.g., ransomware).
- Automated validation of restored data using AI to check for semantic consistency (long-term future).
- **Agent Design:** Adhere to principles in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` for AGI model backup/restore procedures and any AI components involved in DR/backup optimization or validation.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Automated backups are configured and successfully running for at least one critical database and one AGI data store (e.g., KG snapshot).
- [ ] RTO and RPO targets are documented for these critical components.
- [ ] A data restore procedure for the selected database is documented and successfully tested once, meeting a basic RTO/RPO.
- [ ] A basic DR plan outline is drafted, identifying critical services and a target DR approach (e.g., cloud region failover).
- [ ] At least one tabletop DR exercise or restore test is conducted.
- [ ] Monitoring for backup job success/failure is in place for the configured backups.
- [ ] Backups are encrypted and stored in a location separate from the primary data center/region.
- [ ] Documentation for backup and restore procedures for the covered components is available.

## Dependencies
- All other stories in Epic 10, as this strategy covers the entire platform's observability and administrative components.
- Identification of all critical data stores and services across all Epics.
- Cloud provider services for backup, storage, and DR, or on-premise equivalents.
- Sufficient storage capacity for backups.
- `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` for AI agent design and fine-tuning best practices.

## Notes
- A robust BCDR (Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery) strategy is non-negotiable for a financial platform.
- Start with the most critical systems and data, then expand coverage.
- Regular testing is the only way to ensure the DR plan actually works.
- DR is not just about data; it's about recovering entire services and business processes.
- Consider the cost implications of different DR strategies (e.g., hot site vs. cold site).

## Future Enhancements
- Fully automated DR failover and failback with minimal human intervention ("one-click DR").
- Chaos engineering practices to proactively test system resilience against failures.
- Geographically distributed active-active architecture for zero RTO/RPO for some critical services.
- AI-powered prediction of impending disasters or major outages to trigger proactive DR measures.
- Continuous data replication for near-zero RPO.
- Automated validation of DR environment readiness.
