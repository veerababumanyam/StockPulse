# Story 15.3: Build Autonomous Agent Development System

**Epic:** 15 - AGI Orchestration & Multi-Agent Coordination

**User Story:** As an AGI platform, I need to autonomously identify capability gaps and develop new agents or agent features without human intervention to meet evolving user needs.

**Status:** To Do

## Business Context:
This story implements an autonomous agent development system that enables the AGI platform to self-evolve by identifying capability gaps, designing new agents, and deploying them without human intervention. This represents a significant step toward true AGI where the system can adapt and expand its own capabilities based on emerging requirements and opportunities in financial markets.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Capability Gap Detection:**
   - Automated analysis of user requests and system performance to identify capability gaps
   - Pattern recognition detecting recurring problems that current agents cannot solve effectively
   - Market analysis identifying emerging financial domains requiring new expertise
   - Performance monitoring highlighting areas where additional agent capabilities would improve outcomes

2. **Requirements Analysis and Specification Generation:**
   - Automatic generation of detailed requirements for new agents or agent features
   - Analysis of similar existing agents to identify reusable components and patterns
   - Integration requirements analysis ensuring new agents work seamlessly with existing systems
   - Security and safety requirements specification for autonomous agent development

3. **Agent Architecture Design:**
   - Automated architectural design for new agents based on identified requirements
   - Template selection and customization from existing agent patterns
   - Integration point design for seamless connection with existing agent ecosystem
   - Resource requirement estimation for new agent deployment

4. **Autonomous Implementation Pipeline:**
   - Code generation for new agents based on architectural designs and requirements
   - Automated testing frameworks ensuring new agents meet quality and safety standards
   - Deployment automation with rollback capabilities for failed implementations
   - Version control and change management for autonomously developed agents

5. **Validation and Quality Assurance:**
   - Automated testing of new agents against requirements and use cases
   - Performance validation ensuring new agents meet or exceed specified capabilities
   - Safety testing verifying new agents don't introduce security vulnerabilities
   - Integration testing ensuring seamless operation with existing agent ecosystem

6. **Learning and Improvement:**
   - Performance monitoring of autonomously developed agents
   - Feedback incorporation to improve future autonomous development processes
   - Pattern recognition for successful agent development approaches
   - Continuous refinement of development templates and methodologies

## Technical Guidance:

### Backend Architecture:
- **Framework:** Python with code generation libraries (Jinja2, AST manipulation) and automated testing
- **AI/ML:** Large language models for code generation and requirement analysis
- **DevOps:** Automated CI/CD pipelines for agent deployment and testing
- **Monitoring:** Comprehensive telemetry for autonomous development process tracking

  sourceCapabilityGap: string;
  developmentPlan: string;
  deploymentDate: Date;
  performanceMetrics: AgentPerformanceMetrics;

}
```

### Integration with Existing Systems:
- Enables dynamic resource allocation and negotiation across all AI agents
- Integrates with AGI Meta-Agent (Story 7.7) for oversight of resource allocation
- Utilizes Performance Monitoring (Story 8.1) for real-time agent performance data
- **Agent Design:** Agents must be designed to understand and respond to resource negotiation protocols and operate within allocated constraints, as outlined in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`.
