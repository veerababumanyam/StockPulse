# Story 7.6: Build AI Agent Performance Dashboard

**Epic:** 7 - AI Agent Interaction & Personalization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see how my AI agents are performing (e.g., accuracy of predictions, usefulness ratings) over time, so I can understand their value and reliability.

**Status:** To Do

## Business Context:
This story builds user confidence in AI agents by providing transparent performance metrics. By showing measurable agent value and reliability trends, users can make informed decisions about trusting and relying on AI recommendations.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Performance Metrics Dashboard:**
   - Individual performance dashboards for each AI agent
   - Key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to each agent type
   - Historical trend charts showing performance over time
   - Comparison with baseline or benchmark performance

2. **Agent-Specific Performance Indicators:**
   - **Portfolio Analysis Agent:** Prediction accuracy, diversification recommendations success rate
   - **Market Insights Agent:** News relevance score, market prediction accuracy
   - **Trade Advisor Agent:** Risk assessment accuracy, successful trade recommendations
   - **Fraud Detection Agent:** False positive/negative rates, threat detection success

3. **User-Centric Metrics:**
   - User satisfaction ratings aggregated over time
   - Feedback sentiment analysis and trends
   - Action rate on agent recommendations
   - Time saved through agent assistance

4. **Reliability and Trust Indicators:**
   - Agent uptime and availability statistics
   - Response time performance metrics
   - Error rates and failure recovery statistics
   - Data source reliability and freshness indicators

5. **Performance Benchmarking:**
   - Comparison with traditional (non-AI) methods where applicable
   - Industry benchmark comparisons (anonymized)
   - Performance improvement tracking over agent updates
   - Cross-agent performance correlation analysis

6. **Actionable Insights:**
   - Performance alerts for significant changes
   - Recommendations for optimizing agent settings
   - Identification of high/low performing areas
   - Suggested actions based on performance data

## Technical Guidance:

### Frontend Implementation:
- **Framework:** React/TypeScript with data visualization libraries (D3.js, Chart.js)
- **UI Components:** Interactive charts, KPI cards, trend visualizations
- **State Management:** Real-time data updates with caching
- **Performance:** Efficient rendering for large datasets

### API Endpoints:
- `GET /api/agents/{agentId}/performance` - Agent performance metrics
- `GET /api/agents/{agentId}/performance/trends` - Historical performance data
- `GET /api/agents/performance/summary` - Cross-agent performance summary
- `GET /api/agents/performance/benchmarks` - Industry and baseline comparisons
- `POST /api/agents/{agentId}/performance/alerts` - Configure performance alerts

### Performance Data Model:
```typescript
interface AgentPerformanceMetrics {
  agentId: string;
  agentName: string;
  timeframe: string;
  metrics: {
    accuracy: {
      value: number;
      trend: 'up' | 'down' | 'stable';
      benchmark?: number;
    };
    reliability: {
      uptime: number;
      avgResponseTime: number;
      errorRate: number;
    };
    userSatisfaction: {
      averageRating: number;
      feedbackCount: number;
      sentimentScore: number;
    };
    impact: {
      recommendationsGenerated: number;
      recommendationsActedOn: number;
      estimatedTimeSaved: number;
      estimatedValueGenerated?: number;
    };
  };
  trends: {
    date: string;
    value: number;
    metric: string;
  }[];
  alerts: {
    type: 'warning' | 'critical' | 'info';
    message: string;
    timestamp: string;
  }[];
}
```

### Database and Analytics:
- Store performance data in `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB` for efficient time-series queries
- Aggregate real-time metrics in `StockPulse_Redis` for dashboard performance
- Use `StockPulse_PostgreSQL` for configuration and alert settings

### AI Integration:
- Each agent must report standardized performance metrics
- AI Meta-Agent aggregates and analyzes cross-agent performance patterns
- Machine learning for performance prediction and anomaly detection
- **Agent Design:** The performance metrics reported by agents, and how they are benchmarked, should be consistent with the evaluation and monitoring strategies in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`.

## Definition of Done:
- [ ] Performance dashboard accessible from Agent Hub and main navigation
- [ ] Individual agent performance pages with relevant KPIs
- [ ] Historical trend visualization working correctly
- [ ] User satisfaction metrics integrated from feedback system (Story 7.4)
- [ ] Performance alerts and notifications functional
- [ ] Benchmark comparisons displayed where applicable
- [ ] Real-time metrics updates without performance degradation
- [ ] Export functionality for performance reports
- [ ] Mobile responsive design for performance viewing
- [ ] Performance impact calculations accurate and meaningful
- [ ] Unit tests for performance calculation logic (>85% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for metrics collection and aggregation
- [ ] User testing confirms dashboard usefulness and clarity
- [ ] Performance monitoring of the dashboard itself

## Dependencies:
- AI Meta-Agent/Orchestrator (Story 7.7) for metrics aggregation
- Feedback system (Story 7.4) for user satisfaction data
- All AI agents must implement performance metrics reporting
- Time-series database for efficient historical data storage
- Analytics infrastructure for performance calculations
- `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` for AI agent design and fine-tuning best practices.

## Notes:
- Balance transparency with user overwhelm - prioritize actionable metrics
- Ensure performance calculations are statistically sound
- Consider privacy implications of performance data
- Implement data retention policies for performance metrics
- Design for scalability as agent count and data volume grow

## Future Enhancements:
