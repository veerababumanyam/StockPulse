**Story ID:** 10.5
**Story Title:** Comprehensive Audit Logging & Review System
**Assigned to:** Security Team, Backend Team, Compliance Team
**Story Points:** 10

## Business Context
As a StockPulse platform administrator and compliance officer, I need a comprehensive audit logging system that securely records all significant user actions, system events, and administrative changes. This system must provide robust review capabilities to support security investigations, compliance reporting, and troubleshooting, ensuring accountability and traceability across the platform.

## User Story
**As a** platform administrator and compliance officer
**I want to** have a comprehensive audit logging and review system
**So that** I can track all significant platform activities, investigate security incidents, demonstrate compliance with regulations, and ensure accountability for actions taken by users and systems.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Comprehensive Event Coverage for Auditing
- Logging of all security-relevant events (e.g., logins, logouts, failed login attempts, password changes, MFA updates).
- Logging of significant user actions (e.g., financial transactions, data exports, critical settings changes, AGI interaction initiation).
- Logging of administrative actions (e.g., user account management (Story 10.2), role changes, system configuration modifications, alert acknowledgments (Story 10.4)).
- Logging of key system events (e.g., service start/stop, critical errors, automated scaling events, data pipeline executions (Epic 9), KG updates (Story 9.5)).
- Logging of AGI agent actions and decisions, especially those with financial or ethical implications (linking to Story 13.5).
- Standardized audit log format across all components, including timestamp, actor (user/system), action, resource affected, outcome, and IP address.

### 2. Secure & Tamper-Evident Log Storage
- Audit logs are stored securely in a centralized, dedicated log repository.
- Measures to ensure log immutability and tamper-evidence (e.g., write-once storage, digital signatures, blockchain-based logging for critical events - optional).
- Strict access controls for audit logs, limited to authorized personnel (e.g., security analysts, auditors, designated administrators).
- Encryption of audit logs both at rest and in transit.
- Configurable log retention policies based on compliance requirements and business needs.
- Regular backups of audit log data.

### 3. Powerful Audit Log Review & Analysis Tools
- A dedicated user interface for authorized personnel to review and analyze audit logs.
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities (e.g., by user, date range, event type, IP address, resource ID, outcome).
- Ability to correlate audit events from different sources to reconstruct event sequences.
- Visualization tools for identifying patterns or anomalies in audit data.
- Export functionality for audit logs to support external reviews or investigations (e.g., CSV, JSON).
- Saved searches and custom views for frequently performed audit queries.

### 4. Real-Time Alerting on Suspicious Activities
- Integration with the alerting system (Story 10.4) to generate real-time alerts for predefined suspicious or high-risk activities detected in audit logs.
- Examples: multiple failed logins for an admin account, unauthorized access attempts, modification of critical system configurations, large data exports.
- Customizable alert rules based on audit log patterns.
- Escalation procedures for security-critical audit alerts.
- Dashboard widgets showing recent suspicious activities or audit alerts (linking to Story 10.3).

### 5. Compliance Reporting & Support
- Tools to generate audit reports required for various compliance regimes (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001, financial regulations).
- Pre-defined report templates for common audit requests (e.g., user access reviews, privileged activity reports).
- Ability to demonstrate completeness and integrity of audit logs to auditors.
- Support for data requests from legal or regulatory bodies related to audit trails.
- Clear documentation of the audit logging system, scope, and procedures.
- Regular internal reviews of audit logging practices to ensure ongoing compliance.

### 6. User & Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) Foundations
- Collection of audit data in a way that supports basic User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA).
- Establishing baselines for normal user and system behavior based on audit logs.
- Identification of deviations from normal behavior patterns that might indicate insider threats, compromised accounts, or system misuse.
- This is a foundational step; full UEBA system might be a future enhancement.
- Logging of sufficient context to differentiate between normal and anomalous activities.

## Technical Guidance

### Backend Implementation (Python/FastAPI)
```python
# API Endpoints (for accessing and managing audit logs)
POST /api/v1/admin/auditlogs/ingest # Internal endpoint for services to send audit data
GET /api/v1/admin/auditlogs/query
GET /api/v1/admin/auditlogs/report/{report_type}
POST /api/v1/admin/auditlogs/alerts/configure_rule # Links to alerting system

# Key Functions
async def record_audit_event(actor_id, action, resource, outcome, details_json)
async def query_audit_log_store(query_params)
async def generate_compliance_audit_report(report_config)
async def detect_suspicious_activity_from_logs(log_pattern_rule)
async def ensure_log_immutability_and_integrity(log_batch)
```

### Frontend Implementation (TypeScript/React) - (Audit Log Review UI in Admin Portal)
```typescript
interface AuditLogViewerDashboard {
  logEntries: AuditLogRecord[];
  searchFilters: AuditLogSearchCriteria;
  savedSearches: SavedAuditQuery[];
  reportGenerator: AuditReportConfigurator;
  suspiciousActivityAlerts: PlatformAlert[]; // From Story 10.4, filtered for audit events
}

interface AuditLogRecord {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  actorType: 'user' | 'admin' | 'system' | 'agi_agent';
  actorId: string;
  actionName: string;
  resourceAffected?: string;
  resourceId?: string;
  outcome: 'success' | 'failure' | 'pending';
  clientIpAddress?: string;
  userAgent?: string;
  details: Record<string, any>;
}

interface AuditLogSearchCriteria {
  startDate?: Date;
  endDate?: Date;
  actorId?: string;
  actionName?: string;
  outcome?: string;
  freeTextSearch?: string;
}
```

### AI Integration Components
- AI-powered anomaly detection on audit log patterns for advanced threat detection (UEBA features).
- NLP for understanding the intent or context of actions described in free-text log fields.
- Machine learning to predict and flag high-risk activities before they cause significant harm.
- AI-assisted generation of audit report summaries.
- **Agent Design:** Adhere to principles in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` for any AGI agents whose actions are being audited or any AI components analyzing audit logs.

### Database Schema Updates (Typically uses a specialized, secure data store)
```sql
-- Audit logs are often stored in specialized log management systems, data lakes, or secure append-only databases.
-- If a relational DB is used for indexing or a subset, schema might look like:
CREATE TABLE audit_log_entries (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY, -- Use BIGSERIAL for very high volume
    event_id UUID UNIQUE NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    actor_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'USER', 'ADMIN', 'SYSTEM_SERVICE', 'AGI_AGENT'
    actor_identifier VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    action_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'USER_LOGIN', 'CREATE_ORDER', 'UPDATE_SYSTEM_CONFIG'
    resource_type VARCHAR(100),
    resource_identifier VARCHAR(255),
    outcome VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'SUCCESS', 'FAILURE', 'ATTEMPT'
    client_ip_address VARCHAR(45),
    user_agent TEXT,
    source_service VARCHAR(100),
    details JSONB, -- Rich, structured context about the event
    trace_id VARCHAR(255) -- For correlating with other logs
);

-- For ensuring tamper-evidence (conceptual, may use external systems)
CREATE TABLE audit_log_hashes (
    log_batch_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    start_event_id BIGINT REFERENCES audit_log_entries(id),
    end_event_id BIGINT REFERENCES audit_log_entries(id),
    batch_hash TEXT NOT NULL, -- Hash of all log entries in the batch
    previous_batch_hash TEXT, -- Chain of hashes
    hashed_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Key security events (admin login, failed admin login, admin role change) are logged with required details.
- [ ] Significant user actions (e.g., placing a mock trade, changing a critical user setting) are logged.
- [ ] Audit logs are stored in a centralized system, separate from application databases.
- [ ] Authorized administrators can search and filter audit logs via a basic UI (e.g., by user ID and date range).
- [ ] An alert is generated for at least one predefined suspicious activity (e.g., 3 failed admin logins in 5 minutes).
- [ ] Log retention policy for audit logs is defined (e.g., 1 year).
- [ ] Access to audit logs is restricted to a specific administrator role.
- [ ] Basic protection against log tampering is implemented (e.g., logs written to append-only store or regular hashing).
- [ ] Documentation on what events are audited and how to review logs is available.

## Dependencies
- Platform Administrator User Management System (Story 10.2) - for admin identities.
- Centralized Logging & Monitoring Dashboard (Story 10.3) - for potential UI integration or log source.
- Advanced Alerting & Notification System for Administrators (Story 10.4) - for alerting on audit events.
- Secure logging infrastructure (e.g., ELK stack with security features, commercial SIEM, or custom secure data store).
- `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` for AI agent design and fine-tuning best practices.

## Notes
- Comprehensive audit logging is fundamental for security and compliance.
- Defining "significant" events to log requires careful consideration to balance detail with log volume.
- Audit log review should be a regular operational process, not just reactive to incidents.
- Ensure audit logs themselves don't contain overly sensitive data that would create new privacy risks (e.g., full PII in log messages if not necessary).

## Future Enhancements
- Full-fledged User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) system with advanced ML models.
- Automated generation of compliance reports for specific regulations.
- Direct integration with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools.
- Blockchain-based audit trails for maximum immutability and verifiability of critical events.
- "Glass box" auditing for AGI decision processes, showing exactly what data/logic AGI used.
- Proactive audit log analysis to identify potential process inefficiencies or compliance gaps.
