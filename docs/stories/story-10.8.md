### Story 10.8: (Future) Integrate AI for Anomaly Detection in System/Performance Logs

**As a** Platform Administrator or Site Reliability Engineer (SRE),
**I want** AI-powered anomaly detection capabilities integrated with our system, performance, and audit logs,
**So that** potential issues, unusual patterns, security threats, or incipient failures can be proactively identified, flagged, and alerted with context, thereby reducing manual log monitoring effort, minimizing mean time to detection (MTTD), and improving overall platform resilience and security posture.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  **Research & Selection:** Appropriate AI/ML models, algorithms, or specialized AIOps platforms for log anomaly detection are researched, evaluated, and selected based on suitability for StockPulse's data and operational goals.
2.  **Integration:** The chosen AI anomaly detection solution is integrated with the centralized logging systems established in Story 10.7 (Audit Logs) and the metrics systems from Story 10.3 (System Health) and Story 10.4 (AI Agent Observability).
3.  **Scope of Analysis:** The AI system analyzes logs and potentially correlated metrics from core infrastructure (servers, databases, network), application services, and critical AI agents.
4.  **Anomaly Identification:** The system is capable of identifying and flagging statistically significant deviations from established normal operational patterns, including but not limited to:
    *   Unusual spikes or drops in error rates.
    *   Unexpected changes in resource utilization patterns.
    *   Anomalous sequences of events or log messages.
    *   Novel log messages not seen before (potential indicators of new issues or attacks).
    *   Anomalous access patterns or administrative actions from audit logs.
5.  **Alerting & Context:** Alerts generated by the AI anomaly detection system are routed to designated channels (e.g., specific Slack channels, SRE dashboards, ticketing systems). Alerts must include:
    *   Clear description of the detected anomaly.
    *   Timestamp and affected component(s)/service(s).
    *   Supporting evidence (e.g., relevant log snippets, links to metrics dashboards showing correlated deviations).
    *   A confidence score or severity level for the anomaly.
6.  **Feedback Mechanism:** A mechanism is available for administrators or SREs to provide feedback on detected anomalies (e.g., labeling as a true positive, false positive, or providing a root cause category). This feedback is used to refine and retrain the AI models over time.
7.  **Performance Monitoring:** The impact of the AI anomaly detection system on overall system performance (e.g., log ingestion pipelines, query performance, computational resource usage) is monitored and maintained within acceptable limits.
8.  **Documentation:** Clear documentation is provided on how the AI anomaly detection system works, its current capabilities and limitations, how to interpret its findings, and how to provide feedback.
9.  **(Future Iteration) Root Cause Suggestion:** The system may suggest potential root causes or related issues based on learned patterns (this is a more advanced capability).

**Dependencies:**

*   Story 10.3: Setup System Health Monitoring Dashboards & Alerting for Core Infrastructure (provides metrics for correlation)
*   Story 10.4: Create AI Agent Performance & Observability Monitoring Dashboard (provides AI agent metrics for correlation)
*   Story 10.7: Develop Comprehensive Audit Logging for Administrative & Key System Actions (provides log data source)
*   A mature and comprehensive dataset within the centralized logging systems, representing normal operational behavior over a sufficient period.
*   Infrastructure for training and deploying ML models, or budget for a managed AIOps service.

**Stakeholders:**

*   Platform Administrators
*   Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Team
*   AI Operations Team / MLOps Team
*   Security Team
*   Data Science Team (if models are developed in-house)

**Assigned To:**

*   AI R&D Team / Data Science Team (for model development/selection and training)
*   DevOps Team / SRE Team (for infrastructure, integration, and operationalization)

**Priority:** Future

**Status:** To Do

**Architectural Notes:**

*   This initiative will likely involve leveraging advanced machine learning models such as LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks), autoencoders, clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN), or transformer-based models adapted for time-series or log data. Alternatively, specialized commercial or open-source AIOps platforms could be considered.
*   Significant data preprocessing, feature engineering, and log parsing will be required to transform raw logs into a format suitable for ML models.
*   The system will require an initial training phase on historical data to establish a baseline of "normal" behavior. Continuous or periodic retraining will be necessary.
*   Start with a pilot program on a subset of logs or specific services before attempting a full-scale deployment to manage complexity and validate effectiveness.
*   Consider the computational resources (CPU, GPU, memory) required for training and running these AI models in real-time or near real-time.
*   The feedback loop for model improvement is critical for reducing false positives and increasing the accuracy of detections over time.

**Open Questions:**

1.  Which specific AI models, algorithms, or AIOps platforms are most suitable and cost-effective for StockPulse's specific log types and operational objectives?
2.  What are the initial types of anomalies or specific critical services to focus on for the pilot phase?
3.  How will model retraining and updates be managed and automated?
4.  What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring the effectiveness and ROI of the AI anomaly detection system (e.g., reduction in MTTD, number of proactively caught incidents, false positive rate)?
5.  How will the system handle evolving log formats or new applications being introduced?
6.  What are the ethical considerations and potential biases in AI-driven anomaly detection for operational logs?

**QA Notes:**

*   Test the system with curated historical log data containing known incidents and anomalies to evaluate if the AI can detect them accurately.
*   Systematically evaluate the rate of false positives and false negatives under various conditions.
*   Assess the actionability, clarity, and context provided in alerts generated by the AI.
*   Monitor the resource consumption (CPU, memory, storage) of the anomaly detection system itself.
*   Test the feedback mechanism and verify that feedback influences model behavior over time (if testable within a cycle).
*   Evaluate the system's ability to adapt to gradually changing "normal" patterns versus abrupt anomalies.

**User Interface (Conceptual):**

*   Potentially a dedicated dashboard within the Admin Console or integrated with existing monitoring views (e.g., Grafana) to display:
    *   A timeline of detected anomalies.
    *   Details for each anomaly (severity, affected systems, supporting logs/metrics).
    *   Trends in anomaly detection.
    *   An interface for providing feedback (true/false positive, categorization).
    *   Overall health score or confidence level of the AI detection system.
