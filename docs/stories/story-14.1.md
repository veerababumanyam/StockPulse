# Story 14.1: Foundational AGI Knowledge Graph & Semantic Memory Core

**Epic:** Epic 14: AGI Context & Memory Systems
**Story ID:** 14.1
**Story Title:** Foundational AGI Knowledge Graph & Semantic Memory Core
**Assigned to:** AI Research Team, Data Engineering Team  
**Story Points:** 15

## Business Context
As a StockPulse AGI developer, I need a foundational, large-scale AGI Knowledge Graph (KG) and a robust semantic memory core to serve as the central repository of structured and unstructured knowledge, enabling AGI agents to understand complex relationships, retrieve relevant information efficiently, and build a persistent, evolving understanding of the financial world and beyond. ([Source: User stories with examples and a template, Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories))

## User Story
**As an** AGI developer  
**I want to** establish a foundational AGI Knowledge Graph and semantic memory core  
**So that** AGI agents can access, understand, and utilize a vast, interconnected web of knowledge for improved reasoning, context awareness, and decision-making in complex financial domains.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Scalable Knowledge Graph Infrastructure
- Deployment of a scalable graph database (e.g., Neo4j, JanusGraph, Amazon Neptune) capable of handling billions of nodes and relationships.
- Design of a flexible and extensible ontology for the financial domain, covering entities (companies, assets, indicators, events) and relationships (e.g., `subsidiaryOf`, `competesWith`, `influencedBy`).
- Development of robust data ingestion pipelines for populating the KG from diverse sources (structured databases, news feeds, SEC filings, analyst reports, web content - linking to Epic 9).
- High-performance query capabilities for complex graph traversals and pattern matching.
- Mechanisms for KG versioning, backup, and recovery.
- Distributed architecture for high availability and fault tolerance.

### 2. Semantic Representation & Embedding
- Integration of advanced NLP techniques for extracting entities, relationships, and semantic meaning from unstructured text.
- Generation of dense vector embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT, Sentence-BERT) for nodes and text associated with the KG to capture semantic similarity.
- Storage and indexing of these embeddings for efficient similarity search and analogical reasoning.
- Hybrid storage model combining symbolic graph structures with sub-symbolic vector representations.
- Techniques for aligning KG entities with embeddings from pre-trained language models.
- Evaluation framework for the quality of semantic representations and embeddings.

### 3. Knowledge Retrieval & Inferencing Engine
- Development of a sophisticated query language and API for accessing KG data and semantic memory.
- Implementation of inferencing capabilities (e.g., rule-based, ontological reasoning, graph-based inference) to deduce new knowledge from existing facts.
- Support for multi-hop reasoning across the KG to uncover complex relationships.
- Context-aware retrieval mechanisms that consider the AGI agent's current task and goals.
- Integration with vector search engines (e.g., FAISS, Milvus) for semantic similarity lookups.
- Ranking and filtering of retrieval results based on relevance, timeliness, and confidence.

### 4. Continuous Knowledge Acquisition & Evolution
- Automated pipelines for continuous learning and updating of the KG from real-time data streams.
- Mechanisms for AGI agents to contribute new knowledge and experiences back to the KG (supervised and unsupervised learning).
- Conflict resolution and truth maintenance systems to handle contradictory or outdated information.
- Human-in-the-loop interfaces for validating and curating new knowledge entries.
- Monitoring of KG quality, consistency, and coverage over time.
- Feedback loops from AGI task performance to guide knowledge acquisition priorities.

### 5. Multi-Modal Knowledge Integration
- Extension of the KG to incorporate multi-modal information (e.g., images from charts, audio from earnings calls, video from news reports).
- Generation and storage of embeddings for multi-modal data.
- Cross-modal retrieval capabilities (e.g., find images related to a textual concept).
- Semantic linking between textual, visual, and auditory information within the KG.
- Tools for annotating and processing multi-modal data for KG ingestion.
- APIs for AGI agents to query and reason over multi-modal knowledge.

### 6. Security & Access Control for Knowledge
- Granular access control mechanisms for different parts of the KG and semantic memory, based on AGI agent roles and permissions.
- Secure APIs for knowledge access and modification.
- Audit trails for all changes made to the KG.
- Protection against data poisoning attacks or unauthorized modifications to the knowledge base.
- Compliance with data privacy regulations for any personal or sensitive information stored in the KG.
- Encryption of sensitive knowledge elements at rest and in transit.

### Frontend Implementation (TypeScript/React) - (KG Explorer/Admin Interface)
```typescript
interface KnowledgeGraphExplorer {
  id: string;
  graphVisualization: any; // Using libraries like Vis.js, Cytoscape.js
  nodeInspector: KGNodeDetails;
  relationshipEditor: KGRelationshipForm;
  queryBuilder: KGQueryInterface;

  ontologyManager: OntologyEditor;
}

interface KGNodeDetails {
  nodeId: string;
  nodeType: string;
  properties: Record<string, any>;
  connectedRelationships: KGRelationship[];
  semanticEmbeddingVector?: number[]; // For display/analysis
}

interface KGQueryInterface {
  queryLanguage: 'Cypher' | 'SPARQL' | 'GraphQL';
  queryText: string;
  queryParameters?: Record<string, any>;

}
```

### AI Integration Components
- Graph database system (e.g., Neo4j, JanusGraph).
- Vector database system (e.g., Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate).
- NLP libraries for entity extraction, relation extraction (e.g., spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP, AllenNLP).
- Embedding models (e.g., Sentence-Transformers, OpenAI Embeddings API).
- Rule engines for inference (e.g., Drools, Prolog-like systems).
- Data ingestion and ETL frameworks (e.g., Apache NiFi, Airflow).
- KG visualization and exploration tools.
- **Agent Design:** The AGI agents' ability to access, query, interpret, and contribute to this knowledge graph and semantic memory is a fundamental aspect of their design, as detailed in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`.

### Database Schema Updates (Illustrative - actual schema is the graph itself)
```sql
-- Core tables for graph metadata if using a relational DB for some aspects
-- However, the primary data lives IN the graph database.

CREATE TABLE kg_node_types (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    type_name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    description TEXT,
    properties_schema JSONB -- Defines expected properties for this node type
);

CREATE TABLE kg_relationship_types (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    type_name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    description TEXT,
    valid_source_node_types TEXT[],
    valid_target_node_types TEXT[],
    properties_schema JSONB
);

CREATE TABLE kg_ingestion_sources (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    source_name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    source_type VARCHAR(100), -- e.g., 'NewsFeed', 'SEC_Filing', 'Database'
    config JSONB,
    last_ingested_at TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE semantic_embeddings_metadata (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    node_id_or_text_hash VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE, -- Refers to KG node or raw text
    embedding_model_used VARCHAR(100),
    vector_dimensionality INT,
    storage_location TEXT, -- e.g., path in vector DB
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
