# Story 8.6: Implement Customizable Analytics Dashboard Framework

**As a** user (trader, analyst, or investor),
**I want** a framework to create and customize my own analytics dashboards by adding, removing, and arranging various widgets (charts, risk metrics, AI insights, news feeds, portfolio summaries),
**So that** I can have a personalized view of the information and tools most relevant to my specific workflow and analytical needs.

## Description
This story focuses on building a flexible dashboard system where users can construct their own personalized analytical workspaces. This is distinct from predefined dashboards (like the main portfolio dashboard in Epic 2 or AI Agent Hub in Epic 7) and allows for true user customization.

Key features include:
-   **Dashboard Grid System:** A responsive grid-based layout where users can place and resize widgets.
-   **Widget Library:** A library of available widgets that can be added to dashboards, including:
    *   Charts (from Story 8.1, configurable for specific instruments/indicators).
    *   Portfolio Risk Summaries (key metrics from Story 8.2).
    *   Portfolio Optimization Overviews (from Story 8.3).
    *   AI Forecast Snippets (from Story 8.4).
    *   AI Fundamental Insight Summaries (from Story 8.5).
    *   Watchlist widgets (from Epic 2).
    *   News feed widgets (from Story 6.6, configurable by topic/symbol).
    *   Basic portfolio performance widgets (from Epic 2/3).
-   **Add/Remove/Arrange Widgets:** Users can easily add widgets from the library, remove them, and drag-and-drop to rearrange them on the dashboard grid.
-   **Multiple Dashboard Support:** Users can create, save, and name multiple custom dashboards (e.g., "My Tech Analysis Dashboard," "My Portfolio Risk Overview").
-   **Widget Configuration:** Each widget instance should allow for basic configuration (e.g., symbol for a chart widget, specific risk metric for a risk widget).
-   Backend to save user dashboard layouts and widget configurations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Dashboard Creation & Saving:** Users can create a new custom dashboard, name it, and save its layout.
2.  **AC2: Widget Addition & Removal:** Users can add at least 3-4 different types of predefined widgets (e.g., a chart, a news feed, a risk summary) to a custom dashboard and remove them.
3.  **AC3: Widget Arrangement:** Users can rearrange widgets on the dashboard grid using drag-and-drop.
4.  **AC4: Widget Configuration (Basic):** At least two types of widgets allow for basic instance-specific configuration (e.g., setting the stock symbol for a chart widget).
5.  **AC5: Layout Persistence:** Saved dashboard layouts and widget configurations persist across user sessions.
6.  **AC6: Multiple Dashboards:** Users can create and switch between at least two different saved custom dashboards.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   The customizable analytics dashboard framework is functional.
-   Users can create, customize, and save their personal dashboard layouts with a selection of available widgets.
-   Backend for storing dashboard configurations is operational.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and unit/integration tests passed.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) has validated the dashboard customization capabilities.

## AI Integration Details

-   This framework primarily *displays* AI-generated insights as widgets (e.g., AI forecast widget, AI fundamental summary widget).
-   Future AI: An AI agent could potentially suggest relevant widgets or dashboard layouts to a user based on their profile, activity, or stated goals (advanced personalization).

## UI/UX Considerations

-   The dashboard customization process should be highly intuitive and visual (WYSIWYG if possible).
-   Provide a good selection of useful default widgets.
-   Ensure dashboards are responsive and look good on various screen sizes, though complex custom layouts might have limitations.
-   Clear visual distinction between edit mode and view mode for dashboards.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 8: Advanced Analytics & Insights](../epic-8.md)
-   Availability of various analytical components and AI insights from other stories in Epic 8 (8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5) and other Epics (e.g., news from 6.6) to serve as widgets.
-   UI framework supporting grid layouts and drag-and-drop.
-   Backend service to store user dashboard configurations (`StockPulse_PostgreSQL` likely).

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Complexity of building a robust and flexible dashboard framework.
-   Performance implications of dashboards with many active widgets, especially those pulling real-time data.
-   Defining the initial set of available widgets and their configuration options.
-   Managing widget dependencies and versions if they evolve.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Performance:** Dashboards should load quickly, and widgets should update efficiently.
-   **Usability:** Customization interface must be very user-friendly.
-   **Scalability:** System should support many users with multiple custom dashboards.
-   **Stability:** Custom dashboards should be stable and not prone to breaking with widget changes.
