# Story 7.1: Develop AI Agent Hub Dashboard

**As a** user,
**I want** to access a dedicated AI Agent Hub where I can see all active AI agents on my account, their current status (e.g., active, paused, learning, processing), a brief overview of what each agent does for me, and manage their basic interactions,
**So that** I can understand how AI is working on my behalf, have a central place to manage AI interactions, and build trust in the AI-driven features.

## Description
This story involves creating a new UI section, the "AI Agent Hub." This dashboard will serve as the central point for users to see and understand the various AI agents operating within their StockPulse account. It aims to provide transparency, a high-level overview of AI activity, and basic control.

Key features include:
-   A UI page dedicated to the AI Agent Hub, accessible from main navigation.
-   Display a list or card view of all available AI agents relevant to the user (e.g., Portfolio Analysis Agent, Market Insights Agent, Trade Advisor Agent, Fraud Detection Agent, AI Security Assist Agent, AI Notification Preferences Agent).
-   For each agent, display:
    *   Its name and a clear, concise description of its primary function/goal.
    *   Current status (e.g., "Active," "Learning," "Paused by User," "System Paused", "Processing") with clear visual indicators (e.g., green dot for active).
    *   A visual icon representing the agent.
    *   A brief indicator of its last significant activity or a summary metric (e.g., "Last insight: 2 hours ago," "Analyzed 5 news articles today", "Average response time: 2.3s").
    *   Quick enable/disable toggle for non-critical agent functions.
    *   "View Details" link leading to agent-specific activity and settings.
-   Overall summary statistics on the dashboard (e.g., "3 AI Agents active," "15 insights generated this week").

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Agent Hub UI Implemented:** A dedicated AI Agent Hub page/section is created in the UI and is accessible from the main navigation menu with clear breadcrumb navigation.
2.  **AC2: Agent Listing & Overview:** The hub displays a list/cards of all AI agents applicable to the user, showing their name, icon, current status, and a brief description of their role and last activity/performance summary.
3.  **AC3: Real-Time Agent Status Display:** The current operational status of each agent is clearly displayed with visual indicators and updates in real-time (e.g., via WebSocket) without requiring a page refresh. Graceful handling of agent status loading states.
4.  **AC4: Agent Quick Actions:** Quick enable/disable toggles are available for appropriate, non-critical agent functions. A "View Details" link navigates to agent-specific activity logs and settings pages (placeholders if target pages not yet built).
5.  **AC5: Performance Summary Display:** For each agent, high-level performance metrics are shown (e.g., "Provided 12 insights this week", "Average response time: 2.3s") potentially with simple visual indicators (charts/badges).
6.  **AC6: Responsive Design:** The AI Agent Hub dashboard is responsive and usable across different screen sizes (mobile and desktop).
7.  **AC7: Load Performance:** Initial page load of the Agent Hub is under 2 seconds.
8.  **AC8: Accessibility:** UI meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

## Technical Guidance

### Frontend Implementation:
-   **Framework:** React/TypeScript component.
-   **State Management:** React Context/hooks for agent status and real-time updates.
-   **UI Components:** Card-based layout utilizing the existing StockPulse design system.
-   **Real-time Updates:** WebSocket connection established at `/ws/agent-status` for agent status changes.

### API Endpoints (to be provided by AI Meta-Agent - Story 7.7):
-   `GET /api/ai-agents/status`: Retrieve all agent statuses for the authenticated user.
-   `GET /api/ai-agents/{agentId}/summary`: Get agent performance summary for a specific agent.
-   `PUT /api/ai-agents/{agentId}/settings` (or similar): Update agent preferences (e.g., enable/disable state).

### Database Considerations:
-   User agent preferences and settings might be stored in `StockPulse_PostgreSQL`.
-   Frequently accessed agent status could be cached in `StockPulse_Redis` by the backend.
-   Backend to aggregate agent activity metrics for performance display.

### AI Agent Architecture Integration:
-   Each AI agent must expose necessary status and summary APIs to the AI Meta-Agent/Orchestrator.
-   A2A communication might be used by the AI Meta-Agent to coordinate or query agent states.
-   The AI Meta-Agent/Orchestrator (Story 7.7) is central for providing consolidated data to this hub.
-   **Agent Design:** All agents displayed and managed through this hub should adhere to the principles outlined in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Prioritize clarity and simplicity. Users, especially non-technical ones, should easily grasp what each agent does.
-   Avoid overwhelming users with excessive technical jargon or overly complex metrics on this overview dashboard.
-   Maintain a visual design language consistent with the rest of the StockPulse platform.
-   Consider progressive disclosure for more advanced agent features or detailed statistics (on linked pages).
-   Ensure consistent visual representation for all agents.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 7: AI Agent Interaction & Personalization](../epic-7.md)
-   Story 7.7: Develop AI Meta-Agent/Orchestrator Backend (critical for providing data).
-   Definitions of the various AI agents from other epics (e.g., Trade Advisor from Epic 5, Security Assist from Epic 17, etc.) to populate agent names and descriptions.
-   Established UI framework and component library for StockPulse.
-   WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates.
-   Authentication system for user-specific agent data.
-   Guidance from `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Final, confirmed list of AI agents to be displayed at initial launch.
-   Defining the most meaningful and easily understandable summary metrics/activity indicators for each agent at a glance.
-   How to clearly represent agents that might be in a "learning," "initializing," or "degraded performance" state.
-   Specific non-critical agent functions suitable for enable/disable toggles.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Performance:** Dashboard must load quickly (<2s) and respond smoothly to interactions.
-   **Usability:** Must be highly intuitive and easy for non-technical users to understand and navigate.
-   **Accuracy:** Information displayed (agent status, metrics, etc.) must be accurate and reflect the real-time state as closely as possible.
-   **Scalability:** The hub should perform well as the number of users and agents grows.

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for this Story)
-   Drag-and-drop agent priority ordering.
-   Agent performance comparison views.
-   Custom agent grouping/categorization by users.
-   AI-powered agent recommendation engine based on user behavior and goals.
