# Story 15.7: Build AGI Meta-Orchestrator

**Epic:** 15 - AGI Orchestration & Multi-Agent Coordination

**User Story:** As an AGI system, I need a meta-orchestrator that manages higher-level strategy, cross-domain planning, and autonomous system evolution while maintaining alignment with user goals.

**Status:** To Do

## Business Context:
This story implements the AGI Meta-Orchestrator, the highest-level coordination system that manages strategic planning, cross-domain integration, and autonomous evolution of the entire AGI ecosystem. This meta-orchestrator represents the culmination of AGI orchestration capabilities, enabling the system to operate at a strategic level while maintaining coherent direction across all agent activities and autonomous development efforts.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Strategic Planning and Vision Management:**
   - Long-term strategic planning integrating all user goals and system capabilities
   - Vision alignment ensuring all agent activities contribute to coherent strategic objectives
   - Cross-domain strategy coordination spanning financial, technological, and business domains
   - Strategic adaptation responding to changing market conditions and emerging opportunities

2. **System-Wide Orchestration:**
   - Centralized coordination of all major agent networks and subsystems
   - Resource allocation optimization across the entire AGI ecosystem
   - Priority management balancing immediate user needs with long-term strategic objectives
   - Conflict resolution at the highest level when subsystems have competing requirements

3. **Autonomous Evolution Management:**
   - Oversight of autonomous agent development and capability expansion
   - Direction setting for system evolution ensuring alignment with strategic objectives
   - Quality control for autonomous system modifications ensuring they enhance rather than degrade capabilities
   - Safety governance ensuring autonomous evolution maintains system stability and user alignment

4. **Cross-Domain Intelligence Integration:**
   - Integration of insights and capabilities across multiple knowledge domains
   - Synthesis of diverse perspectives into coherent strategic insights
   - Cross-pollination of successful patterns and approaches between different domains
   - Emergence detection identifying new capabilities arising from cross-domain integration

5. **Meta-Learning and System Optimization:**
   - Learning from system-wide performance patterns to optimize overall AGI effectiveness
   - Pattern recognition identifying successful orchestration strategies for replication
   - System architecture optimization ensuring efficient operation as complexity scales
   - Predictive optimization anticipating future needs and preparing appropriate capabilities

6. **Human-AGI Alignment and Governance:**
   - Continuous alignment verification ensuring AGI activities serve human values and goals
   - Transparent governance providing clear oversight and control mechanisms
   - Value preservation ensuring system evolution maintains core ethical principles
   - Trust building through consistent, predictable, and beneficial AGI behavior

## Technical Guidance:

### Backend Architecture:
- **Framework:** Python with advanced orchestration frameworks and meta-learning systems
- **AI/ML:** Advanced reinforcement learning, meta-learning algorithms, and strategic planning AI
- **Architecture:** Microservices with centralized coordination and distributed execution
- **Governance:** Comprehensive logging, auditing, and control systems for AGI oversight

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/meta-orchestrator/strategic-plan` - Generate and update system-wide strategic plans
- `POST /api/meta-orchestrator/coordinate` - Coordinate major system-wide initiatives
- `GET /api/meta-orchestrator/system-status` - Monitor overall AGI system health and performance
- `POST /api/meta-orchestrator/evolve` - Direct autonomous system evolution efforts
- `GET /api/meta-orchestrator/alignment` - Verify and monitor human-AGI alignment status

### Data Models:
```typescript
interface StrategicPlan {
  planId: string;
  planVersion: string;
  visionStatement: string;
  strategicObjectives: StrategicObjective[];
  crossDomainIntegration: CrossDomainStrategy[];
  timeHorizons: TimeHorizon[];
  resourceAllocation: SystemResourceAllocation;
  alignmentVerification: AlignmentStatus;
  lastUpdated: Date;
}

  activeAgentNetworks: NetworkSummary[];
  autonomousEvolutionStatus: EvolutionStatus;
  strategicProgress: ProgressMetrics;
  emergentCapabilities: EmergentCapability[];
  alignmentStatus: AlignmentVerification;

}

interface MetaOrchestrationDecision {

}
```

### Integration with Existing Systems:
- Coordinates all previous Epic 15 stories as subsystems under meta-orchestration
- Integrates with all AGI Foundation capabilities (Epics 11-14) for comprehensive system coordination
- Utilizes advanced safety and ethics frameworks (Epic 13) for alignment verification
- **Agent Design:** While the Meta-Orchestrator itself is a higher-order system, its ability to understand, direct, and evolve underlying agents is critical. All agents must be designed to be compatible with this top-level orchestration, as detailed in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`.
