# Story 6.4: Integrate Forex & Cryptocurrency Real-Time Data Feeds

**As a** system (StockPulse platform, its AI agents, and users trading Forex/Cryptocurrencies),
**I need** to integrate real-time data feeds for major Forex pairs and a wide range of cryptocurrencies,
**So that** users can monitor and trade these asset classes, and AI agents can perform cross-asset analysis and generate insights/strategies involving FX and crypto.

## Description
This story involves connecting to data providers for real-time Forex (Foreign Exchange) data and cryptocurrency data. This includes live bid/ask quotes, last trade prices, and volume for various currency pairs and crypto tokens.

Key features include:
-   Identify and integrate with data providers for real-time Forex data (e.g., OANDA, TrueFX, an aggregator like IEX Cloud or Polygon.io if they offer FX).
-   Identify and integrate with data providers for real-time cryptocurrency data from major exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase Pro via their APIs, Kraken, or aggregators like CoinMarketCap API, CryptoCompare).
-   Subscribe to a relevant set of major and minor Forex pairs (e.g., EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, AUD/USD, USD/CAD, and key cross-rates).
-   Subscribe to a wide range of liquid cryptocurrencies (e.g., BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, ADA, SOL, DOT, and other top N by market cap).
-   Process incoming real-time data messages for quotes (bid/ask), trades, and volume.
-   Normalize received data into a standard internal format, consistent with how equity data is handled where applicable.
-   Publish normalized real-time FX and crypto data to an internal message bus/stream.
-   Store real-time FX and crypto data points in `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`.
-   Robust error handling, connection management, and monitoring for these data feeds.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Forex Data Provider Integration:** The system successfully connects to and authenticates with the chosen real-time Forex data provider(s).
2.  **AC2: Crypto Data Provider Integration:** The system successfully connects to and authenticates with the chosen real-time cryptocurrency data provider(s)/exchange APIs.
3.  **AC3: Data Reception (FX & Crypto):** The system receives a continuous stream of real-time data (quotes, trades, volume) for subscribed Forex pairs and cryptocurrencies.
4.  **AC4: Data Normalization & Storage:** Incoming FX and crypto data is parsed, normalized, and stored in `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB` with correct timestamps, symbols/pairs, and metadata.
5.  **AC5: Internal Publication:** Normalized real-time FX and crypto data is published to an internal message bus for consumption by other platform services.
6.  **AC6: Error Handling & Resilience:** Connections to FX and crypto data feeds are resilient, with proper error handling and reconnection logic.
7.  **AC7: Monitoring:** Basic monitoring is in place for feed health (message rates, connection status, error rates) for both FX and crypto feeds.
8.  **AC8: Data Accessibility:** FX and Crypto real-time data is accessible via the internal Data Access API Layer (Story 6.9).

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   Real-time data feed integrations for Forex and cryptocurrencies are operational.
-   Data for specified pairs/tokens is flowing, normalized, published internally, and stored.
-   Connection management and basic monitoring are implemented.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and unit/integration tests passed.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) confirms data availability and accuracy for sample FX pairs and crypto tokens.

## AI Integration Details

-   FX and crypto data are essential for AI agents performing cross-market analysis, arbitrage opportunity detection (if in scope), and developing diversified trading strategies.
-   AI can be used for anomaly detection in these feeds (Story 6.8).

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Enables UI features for displaying real-time FX rates and crypto prices (handled in other epics/stories).

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 6: Data Sources & Market Integration](../epic-6.md)
-   `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB` setup for FX and crypto data.
-   Internal message bus/streaming infrastructure.
-   API keys/access for chosen FX and crypto data providers.
-   Story 6.9 (Design & Implement Internal Data Access API Layer).

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Selection of data providers for FX and crypto: Reliability, cost, breadth of coverage (pairs/tokens), API quality, and data licensing terms are key considerations.
-   Managing connections to multiple crypto exchanges if an aggregator is not used.
-   Normalization challenges due to varying data formats and conventions across different crypto exchanges and FX providers.
-   Data rate limits and costs, especially for a large number of crypto tokens.
-   Regulatory considerations for crypto data in different jurisdictions.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Timeliness:** Data should be as real-time as providers allow.
-   **Accuracy:** Data must accurately reflect market activity for FX and crypto.
-   **Reliability:** Data feed connections must be stable.
-   **Scalability:** Must handle a growing list of FX pairs and crypto tokens.
