# Story 5.7: Develop AI Trade Advisor Agent (Backend)

**As a** backend system (and by extension, various frontend services like order entry, notifications, and trade history),
**I need** a robust AI Trade Advisor Agent capable of providing pre-trade insights, suggesting order parameters, generating post-trade analysis, and adding context to notifications,
**So that** the StockPulse application can deliver intelligent, AI-enhanced trading features to the user as defined in Epic 5.

## Description
This story is foundational for many AI-driven features within Epic 5. It involves creating a backend AI agent/service responsible for various analytical and advisory tasks related to trading. This agent will be called by other backend services or may process data streams to generate insights.

Key functionalities of the AI Trade Advisor Agent:
1.  **Pre-Trade Insights (for Story 5.1):**
    *   Analyze user's trading goals, risk profile (from User Profile - separate Epic), and market context for a given stock.
    *   Provide insights on potential risks, alignment with goals, and relevant market conditions.
2.  **Order Parameter Suggestion (for Story 5.2):**
    *   Suggest optimal parameters for stop-loss or take-profit orders based on volatility, support/resistance levels, or user preferences.
3.  **Post-Trade Analysis (for Story 5.5):**
    *   Analyze executed trades against market conditions, pre-trade intentions (if known), and portfolio impact.
    *   Generate summaries of trade outcomes and performance.
4.  **Notification Contextualization (for Story 5.6):**
    *   Provide brief, relevant commentary for order event notifications (fills, rejections) based on trade details and market context.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Pre-Trade Insight Generation:** Given a stock symbol, user context (e.g., goals, risk profile ID), and current market data, the agent can generate and return structured pre-trade insights (e.g., risk assessment, goal alignment score, key market factors).
2.  **AC2: Order Parameter Suggestion:** Given a stock, order type (e.g., stop-loss), and user preferences, the agent can calculate and return suggested price levels or parameters with rationale.
3.  **AC3: Post-Trade Analysis Generation:** Given details of an executed trade (symbol, price, quantity, timestamp, original order context), the agent can generate a structured post-trade analysis (e.g., impact summary, outcome assessment vs. benchmarks/goals).
4.  **AC4: Notification Context Generation:** Given an order event (e.g., fill, rejection) and its details, the agent can generate a concise contextual comment suitable for a user notification.
5.  **AC5: API Endpoints/Service Interface:** The agent exposes clear, well-documented API endpoints (or service interfaces if internal) for each of its functionalities.
6.  **AC6: Data Source Integration:** The agent correctly integrates with necessary data sources: User Profile data, Market Data (real-time and historical from `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`), Portfolio Data, Order/Trade Data (`StockPulse_PostgreSQL`), and potentially `StockPulse_VectorDB` for RAG.
7.  **AC7: Scalability & Performance:** The agent is designed to handle concurrent requests efficiently and provide responses within acceptable latency for a good user experience (especially for pre-trade insights).
8.  **AC8: Configurability & Modularity:** The agent's models, rules, and data source connections are configurable. Different analytical modules (pre-trade, post-trade, etc.) are relatively independent.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   Backend AI Trade Advisor Agent service/module is implemented and deployed.
-   All specified functionalities (pre-trade, parameter suggestion, post-trade, notification context) are operational via API/service calls.
-   Integration with all required data sources is functional and tested.
-   The agent meets performance and scalability considerations for its intended use cases.
-   Comprehensive logging and monitoring are in place for the agent's operations.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and unit/integration tests passed.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) has confirmed that the agent's capabilities meet the requirements of the dependent user stories (5.1, 5.2, 5.5, 5.6).

## AI Integration Details

-   **Agent:** This story IS the AI Trade Advisor Agent itself.
-   **Task:** Perform various analytical tasks as described.
-   **Models:** This will likely involve a combination of:
    *   **LLMs (Large Language Models):** For generating textual insights, summaries, and contextual comments. Potentially using RAG with `StockPulse_VectorDB` for grounding.
    *   **Statistical/ML Models:** For quantitative analysis, e.g., volatility calculations, price movement predictions (if within scope), risk scoring.
    *   **Rule-Based Systems:** For specific checks or conditional logic.
-   **Data Sources:**
    *   `StockPulse_PostgreSQL`: User profiles (risk, goals), portfolio holdings, order/trade history, saved AI parameters from orders.
    *   `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`: Real-time and historical market data (prices, volume, technical indicators).
    *   `StockPulse_VectorDB`: Financial news, research documents, predefined trading knowledge base for RAG-enhanced LLM responses.
    *   External financial data APIs (if needed for data not in local DBs).
-   **Workflow:** The agent will likely have different internal workflows/pipelines for each of its main functions, triggered by API calls from other services.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Not directly applicable (backend service), but the outputs of this agent heavily influence UI/UX in other stories. Clarity, conciseness, and actionability of the agent's outputs are paramount.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 5: Trading & Order Management](../epic-5.md)
-   Dependent User Stories: 5.1, 5.2, 5.5, 5.6 (this agent provides backend logic for them).
-   Data Infrastructure: `StockPulse_PostgreSQL`, `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`, `StockPulse_VectorDB` must be operational and accessible.
-   User Profile Management system (for user-specific context).
-   Market Data Ingestion pipelines.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   **Complexity:** This is a highly complex story. Defining the exact scope and sophistication of each AI capability is crucial.
-   **Model Selection & Training:** Choosing/fine-tuning appropriate LLMs and ML models.
-   **Data Quality & Availability:** Ensuring high-quality, timely data from all sources.
-   **Prompt Engineering:** Significant effort required for effective prompt engineering if using LLMs.
-   **Explainability:** How to make AI suggestions and analyses understandable and trustworthy (even if full explainability is hard).
-   **Ethical Considerations & Bias:** Ensuring AI advice is fair, unbiased, and doesn't lead to harmful outcomes. Adherence to financial advice regulations.
-   **Testing & Validation:** Rigorous testing of AI outputs is challenging but essential.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Accuracy:** AI insights and suggestions should be as accurate and reliable as possible, with known limitations stated.
-   **Latency:** Pre-trade insights needed for order entry must be low-latency.
-   **Scalability:** Must handle requests from many users.
-   **Maintainability:** Code and models should be well-documented and maintainable.
-   **Security:** Secure API endpoints and data handling.
