# Story 9.1: Implement Deep Liquidity and Order Flow Analysis

**Epic:** [Epic 9: Market Microstructure & Liquidity Intelligence](../epic-9.md)

**Status:** To Do

**Priority:** High

**Estimated Effort:** 16 Story Points (4 weeks)

## User Story

**As a** day trader or high-frequency trader
**I want** real-time order book analysis with dark pool activity detection and liquidity visualization
**So that** I can identify liquidity imbalances, detect potential price manipulation, and make informed trading decisions based on market microstructure

## Description

Implement a comprehensive market microstructure analysis module that provides real-time order book visualization, dark pool activity monitoring, and liquidity heatmap generation. This system will help traders understand market depth, identify institutional trading patterns, and detect potential price manipulation signals through advanced order flow analysis.

The module leverages the AG-UI framework to dynamically generate optimal interfaces based on market conditions and detected patterns, providing traders with contextual visualizations and alerts.
