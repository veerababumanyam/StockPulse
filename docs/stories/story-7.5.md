# Story 7.5: Develop Agent Education Center

**Epic:** 7 - AI Agent Interaction & Personalization

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to clear explanations of what each AI agent does, what data it uses, and how it helps me, so I can understand and trust the AI assistance I'm receiving.

**Status:** To Do

## Business Context:
This story builds user trust and confidence in AI agents by providing transparent, educational content about how each agent works. Understanding AI capabilities reduces anxiety and increases adoption, while supporting our goal of ethical and explainable AI.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Agent Overview Pages:**
   - Dedicated page for each AI agent with comprehensive explanation
   - Plain language description of agent purpose and capabilities
   - Visual diagrams showing agent workflow and decision-making process
   - Real examples of agent outputs and recommendations

2. **Data Source Transparency:**
   - Clear listing of data sources each agent uses
   - Explanation of how data is processed and analyzed
   - Data freshness indicators and update frequencies
   - Privacy and security information for data handling

3. **Decision Making Explanation:**
   - Step-by-step breakdown of how agents reach conclusions
   - Explanation of AI reasoning methods (RAG, neural networks, etc.) in simple terms
   - Common scenarios and how agents handle them
   - Limitations and edge cases clearly stated

4. **Interactive Learning Elements:**
   - AI agent simulation/demo mode for safe exploration
   - "Ask the Agent" interface for questions about capabilities
   - Interactive tutorials showing agent features
   - Glossary of AI and financial terms

5. **Trust Building Content:**
   - Agent development history and continuous improvement process
   - Safety measures and error handling explanations
   - User testimonials and success stories
   - Comparison with traditional (non-AI) approaches

6. **Accessibility and Learning Paths:**
   - Content tailored to different experience levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
   - Video explanations and animated demonstrations
   - Searchable FAQ section for each agent
   - Progressive disclosure of technical details

## Technical Guidance:

### Frontend Implementation:
- **Framework:** React/TypeScript with rich media support
- **UI Components:** Interactive diagrams, video players, simulation interfaces
- **Content Management:** Markdown-based content with dynamic elements
- **Search:** Full-text search across all educational content

### API Endpoints:
- `GET /api/education/agents` - List all agents with basic info
- `GET /api/education/agents/{agentId}` - Detailed agent information
- `GET /api/education/agents/{agentId}/demo` - Agent demo/simulation data
- `POST /api/education/agents/{agentId}/questions` - Ask agent capability questions
- `GET /api/education/glossary` - AI and financial terms glossary

### Content Data Model:
```typescript
interface AgentEducationContent {
  agentId: string;
  agentName: string;
  description: string;
  capabilities: string[];
  limitations: string[];
  dataSources: {
    name: string;
    description: string;
    updateFrequency: string;
    privacyLevel: 'public' | 'private' | 'aggregated';
  }[];
  decisionProcess: {
    step: number;
    title: string;
    description: string;
    example?: string;
  }[];
  useCases: {
    scenario: string;
    agentResponse: string;
    explanation: string;
  }[];
  safetyMeasures: string[];
  lastUpdated: string;
}
```

### Integration with AI Agents:
- Agents must provide educational metadata through their APIs
- Real-time capability and limitation updates from agent systems
- Integration with AI Meta-Agent for current status and performance data
- **Agent Design:** The explanations of agent behavior, data usage, and decision-making processes should be consistent with the transparency and explainability principles from `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`.

## Definition of Done:
- [ ] Education center accessible from main navigation and Agent Hub
- [ ] Comprehensive content pages for all existing AI agents
- [ ] Interactive demo/simulation mode functional for each agent
- [ ] "Ask the Agent" Q&A interface working correctly
- [ ] Search functionality across all educational content
- [ ] Content personalized for user experience level
- [ ] Video and animated content integrated successfully
- [ ] Glossary comprehensive and searchable
- [ ] Mobile responsive design implemented and tested
- [ ] Content management system for easy updates
- [ ] Analytics tracking user engagement with educational content
- [ ] User testing confirms content clarity and helpfulness
