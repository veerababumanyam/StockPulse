# Story 5.1: Implement Order Entry Form with AI Pre-Trade Insights

**As a** user (active trader or casual investor),
**I want** an order entry form where I can select a stock, specify buy/sell, quantity, and choose order types (initially Market and Limit), and importantly, see AI-generated pre-trade insights (e.g., on risk, market context, alignment with my goals) before I proceed to order preview,
**So that** I can make more informed trading decisions with contextual AI assistance right at the point of order creation.

## Description
This story covers the development of the primary interface for initiating trades. It includes standard order entry fields (symbol, action, type, quantity, limit price) and a key differentiator: the integration of AI-driven pre-trade analysis provided by the "AI Trade Advisor Agent." This analysis aims to give users immediate context and potential considerations before they commit to an order.

Key features include:
-   Standard order inputs:
    -   Symbol selection (can be pre-filled or searchable).
    -   Buy/Sell action.
    -   Order Type (initially Market, Limit. Story 5.2 will add Stop/Stop-Limit).
    -   Quantity (shares).
    -   Limit Price (for Limit orders).
    -   Time-in-Force (for Limit orders, e.g., Day, GTC - Good 'Til Canceled).
-   Display of contextual market data (e.g., current bid/ask, day's range).
-   Display of user-specific context (e.g., available buying power, current holdings of the symbol).
-   **AI Pre-Trade Insights Section:** A clearly designated area that displays:
    -   AI assessment of potential risks associated with the contemplated trade (e.g., based on volatility, news sentiment, market conditions).
    -   AI comment on how the trade might align or conflict with the user's stated portfolio goals (if such goals are defined by the user elsewhere).
    -   Brief AI summary of current market conditions relevant to the stock or its sector.
-   Estimated cost/proceeds.
-   Client-side validations.
-   Button to proceed to Order Preview & Confirmation (Story 5.3).

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Standard Inputs Present:** The form includes fields for Symbol, Buy/Sell Action, Order Type (Market/Limit), Quantity, Limit Price (if Limit type), and Time-in-Force (if Limit type).
2.  **AC2: Contextual Data Display:** Current market price (bid/ask), user's buying power (for buy), and current holdings (for sell) are displayed.
3.  **AC3: AI Pre-Trade Insights Displayed:** Once a symbol and basic order parameters (e.g., action, quantity) are entered, an AI-generated pre-trade insights section is populated. This includes risk assessment, goal alignment (if applicable), and market context.
4.  **AC4: AI Insights Attributed:** AI-generated content is clearly marked as such (e.g., "AI Trade Advisor Suggestion").
5.  **AC5: Calculations:** Estimated cost (for buy) or proceeds (for sell) are accurately calculated and displayed.
6.  **AC6: Validations:** Standard client-side validations for required fields, numeric inputs, etc., are implemented. Submission is prevented for invalid forms.
7.  **AC7: Proceed to Preview:** A "Preview Order" button, when clicked with a valid form, navigates the user to the Order Preview stage (Story 5.3), passing all order details and AI insights.
8.  **AC8: Performance of AI Insights:** AI insights are loaded and displayed within a reasonable timeframe after essential order parameters are input (e.g., < 3-5 seconds).
9.  **AC9: UI/UX:** The form is intuitive, AI insights are presented clearly without overwhelming the user, and the overall experience is seamless.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   Order entry form UI implemented.
-   Integration with AI Trade Advisor Agent for pre-trade insights is functional.
-   Relevant market data and user portfolio data services are integrated.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and unit/integration tests (including for AI insight display) passed.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) has reviewed and approved the functionality, including the presentation and relevance of AI insights.

## AI Integration Details

-   **Agent:** AI Trade Advisor Agent.
-   **Task:** Provide pre-trade analysis (risk, market conditions, goal alignment).
-   **Models:** LLM with RAG capabilities.
-   **Data Sources for AI Insights:**
    -   `StockPulse_VectorDB`: Market news, risk management principles, trading strategy documents, sentiment analysis results.
    -   `StockPulse_PostgreSQL`: User portfolio data (holdings, defined goals - if available), historical user trading patterns (future).
    -   `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`: Real-time and historical price/volume data for volatility and trend analysis.
    -   Real-time market data APIs.
-   **Flow for AI Insights:**
    1.  User inputs stock symbol, action, quantity.
    2.  Frontend sends these parameters to the AI Trade Advisor Agent.
    3.  Agent gathers necessary data (market data, news from VectorDB, user context from PostgreSQL).
    4.  Agent analyzes data and generates insights (risk, goal alignment, market context).
    5.  Agent returns insights to the frontend for display.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   AI insights should be presented as helpful advice, not prescriptive instructions.
-   Clear visual distinction for AI-generated content.
-   Allow users to proceed even if AI insights suggest caution (user retains control).
-   Consider how to handle cases where AI insights take a moment to load.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 5: Trading & Order Management](../epic-5.md)
-   AI Trade Advisor Agent (backend logic and API - Story 5.7 will cover its full development, but an initial version or endpoint for this specific task is needed).
-   Services for market data (quotes) and user portfolio data (buying power, holdings).
-   Order Preview & Confirmation (Story 5.3) as the next step.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Defining the initial scope and depth of AI pre-trade insights. What are the MVP insights?
-   How are user portfolio goals captured and made available to the AI agent?
-   Latency of AI insight generation â€“ ensuring it doesn't unduly slow down the order entry process.
-   User acceptance and trust in AI-generated pre-trade insights.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Performance:** AI insights should load quickly (as per AC8).
-   **Reliability:** AI insight generation should be reliable; failures should be handled gracefully (e.g., allow order entry without insights, with a message).
-   **Clarity:** AI insights must be clear, concise, and unambiguous.
