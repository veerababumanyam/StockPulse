# Story 7.7: Develop AI Meta-Agent/Orchestrator Backend

**Epic:** 7 - AI Agent Interaction & Personalization

**User Story:** As a platform developer, I need a backend AI Meta-Agent that manages agent activity logging, processes user feedback, and coordinates agent interactions for the Agent Hub interface.

**Status:** To Do

## Business Context:
This story implements the central orchestration system that coordinates all AI agents, manages their interactions, processes feedback, and provides the backend foundation for the entire AI agent ecosystem. This is critical for AGI-ready architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Agent Registry and Management:**
   - Centralized registry of all available AI agents with capabilities and status
   - Dynamic agent discovery and registration system
   - Agent health monitoring and failover management
   - Version control and update coordination for agents

2. **Activity Logging and Processing:**
   - Standardized activity logging interface for all agents
   - Real-time activity stream processing and aggregation
   - Translation of technical logs to user-friendly descriptions using RAG
   - Activity categorization, prioritization, and filtering

3. **Feedback Processing and Learning:**
   - Centralized feedback collection from all user interactions
   - Feedback analysis and pattern identification using ML
   - Personalization engine based on user feedback patterns
   - A2A communication of feedback insights to relevant agents

4. **Agent Coordination and Communication:**
   - A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication protocol implementation
   - Request routing and load balancing between agents
   - Conflict resolution when agents provide contradictory recommendations
   - Cross-agent context sharing and coordination

5. **Performance Monitoring and Analytics:**
   - Real-time performance metrics collection from all agents
   - Performance trend analysis and anomaly detection
   - Resource utilization monitoring and optimization
   - SLA monitoring and alerting

6. **User Preference Management:**
   - Centralized storage and distribution of user agent preferences
   - Real-time preference updates to all relevant agents
   - Preference conflict resolution and validation
   - Default and template preference management

## Technical Guidance:

### Backend Architecture:
- **Framework:** Node.js/TypeScript with microservices architecture
- **Message Queue:** Redis Streams for A2A communication
- **Event Processing:** Event-driven architecture with pub/sub patterns
- **Load Balancing:** Dynamic load balancing with health checks

### Core Services:
```typescript
interface MetaAgentCore {
  agentRegistry: AgentRegistryService;
  activityProcessor: ActivityProcessingService;
  feedbackEngine: FeedbackProcessingService;
  communicationHub: A2ACommunicationService;
  performanceMonitor: PerformanceMonitoringService;
  preferenceManager: UserPreferenceService;
}

interface AgentRegistration {
  agentId: string;
  agentName: string;
  version: string;
  capabilities: string[];
  endpoints: {
    health: string;
    execute: string;
    settings: string;
    metrics: string;
  };
  dependencies: string[];
  resourceRequirements: {
    cpu: number;
    memory: number;
    gpu?: boolean;
  };
}
```

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/meta-agent/agents/register` - Register new agent
- `GET /api/meta-agent/agents` - List all registered agents
- `POST /api/meta-agent/activities/log` - Log agent activity
- `POST /api/meta-agent/communication/send` - A2A message sending
- `GET /api/meta-agent/performance/summary` - Performance overview
- `PUT /api/meta-agent/preferences/{userId}` - Update user preferences

### Database Integration:
- **Agent Registry:** `StockPulse_PostgreSQL` for persistent agent metadata
- **Activity Logs:** `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB` for efficient time-series storage
- **Real-time Data:** `StockPulse_Redis` for caching and message queuing
- **Knowledge Base:** `StockPulse_VectorDB` for RAG-powered activity descriptions

### A2A Communication Protocol:
```typescript
interface A2AMessage {
  messageId: string;
  fromAgent: string;
  toAgent: string;
  messageType: 'request' | 'response' | 'notification' | 'alert';
  payload: any;
  priority: 'low' | 'normal' | 'high' | 'critical';
  timestamp: string;
  expiresAt?: string;
  correlationId?: string;
}
```
- **Agent Design:** The Meta-Agent itself, and the protocols it defines for inter-agent communication, logging, and feedback, must align with the overarching principles in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`.

## Definition of Done:
- [ ] Agent registry system functional with dynamic registration
- [ ] A2A communication protocol implemented and tested
- [ ] Activity logging pipeline processing all agent activities
- [ ] Feedback processing engine analyzing user input and generating insights
- [ ] Performance monitoring collecting metrics from all agents
- [ ] User preference management distributing settings to agents
- [ ] Health monitoring and failover mechanisms working correctly
- [ ] Real-time activity translation to user-friendly descriptions
- [ ] Agent coordination preventing conflicts and optimizing responses
- [ ] Load balancing and resource optimization functional
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities
- [ ] Unit tests for all core services (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for A2A communication and agent coordination
- [ ] Performance tests ensuring scalability requirements
- [ ] Security audit for agent communication and data handling

## Dependencies:
- All individual AI agents must implement Meta-Agent communication interfaces
- Message queue infrastructure (Redis Streams)
- Database infrastructure (`StockPulse_PostgreSQL`, `StockPulse_Redis`, `StockPulse_VectorDB`, `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB`)
- Security framework for agent authentication and authorization
- `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` for AI agent design and fine-tuning best practices.

## Notes:
- This is the foundation for AGI-ready architecture - design for future expansion
- Implement circuit breakers and graceful degradation for agent failures
- Design for horizontal scaling as agent count grows
- Consider implementing agent marketplace functionality for future extensibility
- Ensure all communication is logged for debugging and compliance

## Future Enhancements:
