# Story 6.5: Implement Company Fundamental Data Integration (Financials, Filings)

**As a** system (StockPulse platform, its AI agents, and users performing fundamental analysis),
**I need** to integrate comprehensive company fundamental data, including financial statements, SEC filings, earnings reports, analyst ratings, and corporate actions,
**So that** AI agents can perform deep fundamental analysis, users can research company health and performance, and the platform can provide rich contextual data alongside market prices.

## Description
This story focuses on acquiring, processing, and storing a wide range of company fundamental data. This data is critical for valuation, assessing financial health, and understanding corporate strategy and performance.

Key features include:
-   Identify and integrate with data providers for company fundamental data (e.g., SEC EDGAR database directly, commercial providers like Refinitiv, FactSet, Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud for some fundamentals).
-   Ingest historical and ongoing company financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) on a quarterly and annual basis.
-   Ingest SEC filings (e.g., 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K) and make them accessible, potentially extracting key information or linking to original documents.
-   Integrate data on earnings reports (actual vs. estimates, transcripts if available).
-   Incorporate analyst ratings, price targets, and earnings estimates.
-   Track and integrate data on corporate actions (e.g., dividends, stock splits, mergers & acquisitions).
-   Normalize all fundamental data into a standard internal format.
-   Store structured fundamental data primarily in `StockPulse_PostgreSQL` (for relational data like statements, ratings) and potentially `StockPulse_VectorDB` for textual data from filings/transcripts after processing.
-   Develop ETL processes for fetching, validating, and updating fundamental data.
-   Implement mechanisms for handling restatements or corrections to historical fundamental data.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Fundamental Data Provider Integration:** The system successfully connects to and fetches data from chosen fundamental data provider(s)/sources.
2.  **AC2: Financial Statement Coverage:** Quarterly and annual financial statements (Income, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow) are ingested for a defined universe of companies for a significant historical period.
3.  **AC3: SEC Filings & Earnings Data:** Key SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K) and earnings report data (actual, estimates) are ingested and linked to respective companies.
4.  **AC4: Analyst Ratings & Corporate Actions:** Analyst ratings, price targets, and corporate action data (dividends, splits) are ingested and updated regularly.
5.  **AC5: Data Normalization & Storage:** Fundamental data is normalized and stored in appropriate databases (`StockPulse_PostgreSQL` for structured, `StockPulse_VectorDB` for processed text) with clear schemas.
6.  **AC6: Data Update & Accuracy:** Processes are in place to regularly update fundamental data as new information is released (e.g., new quarterly reports, filings). Basic validation checks are performed.
7.  **AC7: Error Handling & Logging:** Ingestion processes for fundamental data include robust error handling and logging.
8.  **AC8: Data Accessibility:** Fundamental data is accessible via the internal Data Access API Layer (Story 6.9) for use by AI agents and UI components.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   Fundamental data integration pipeline is operational.
-   Specified fundamental data types are being ingested, processed, and stored correctly.
-   Data is accessible through the internal API.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and unit/integration tests passed.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) confirms availability and accuracy of fundamental data for sample companies.

## AI Integration Details

-   Fundamental data is a cornerstone for many AI-driven financial analyses, including valuation models, risk assessment, earnings prediction, and generating qualitative summaries of company performance (e.g., from earnings call transcripts processed via RAG with `StockPulse_VectorDB`).
-   AI can assist in extracting structured information from unstructured filings or news related to fundamentals.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Enables UI features displaying company financial statements, key ratios, SEC filing links, earnings history, analyst ratings, etc. (handled in other epics/stories).

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 6: Data Sources & Market Integration](../epic-6.md)
-   `StockPulse_PostgreSQL` and potentially `StockPulse_VectorDB` setup.
-   API keys/access for chosen fundamental data providers or mechanisms for SEC EDGAR scraping.
-   Story 6.9 (Design & Implement Internal Data Access API Layer).

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Selection of fundamental data provider(s): Balancing cost, comprehensiveness, accuracy, timeliness, and depth of history.
-   Complexity of parsing and normalizing data from diverse sources (especially SEC filings).
-   Handling historical restatements and ensuring data accuracy over time.
-   Volume of data, particularly if storing full text of filings or detailed historical statements for many companies.
-   Mapping company identifiers across different data sources.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Data Accuracy:** Fundamental data must be highly accurate.
-   **Completeness:** Coverage of companies and data points should be as comprehensive as defined.
-   **Timeliness:** New fundamental data (e.g., earnings releases, filings) should be ingested promptly.
-   **Reliability:** Data ingestion processes must be reliable.
