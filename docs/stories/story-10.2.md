# Story 10.2: Platform Administrator User Management System

**Epic:** Epic 10: Platform Administration & Observability
**Story ID:** 10.2
**Story Title:** Platform Administrator User Management System
**Assigned to:** Backend Team, Security Team  
**Story Points:** 8

## Business Context
As a StockPulse platform super-administrator, I need a secure and efficient system for managing other administrator accounts, including creating, modifying, and deactivating admin users, assigning roles and permissions, and tracking their activities. This is essential for maintaining platform security, ensuring proper delegation of administrative tasks, and complying with access control policies. ([Source: User stories with examples and a template, Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories))

## User Story
**As a** super-administrator  
**I want to** have a comprehensive user management system for platform administrators  
**So that** I can securely create, manage, and assign roles/permissions to other administrators, ensuring appropriate access control and operational security for the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Secure Admin Account Creation & Lifecycle Management
- Super-administrators can create new platform administrator accounts with unique credentials.
- Secure password policies are enforced for admin accounts (complexity, expiry, history).
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for all administrator accounts.
- Admin accounts can be activated, deactivated, or suspended by super-administrators.
- Offboarding process to securely revoke access for departing administrators.
- Self-service password reset for administrators (with MFA verification).

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Administrators
- Definition of distinct administrator roles with specific sets of permissions (e.g., User Admin, Content Admin, System Config Admin, AGI Monitoring Admin, Audit Admin).
- Super-administrators can assign one or more roles to administrator accounts.
- Permissions are granular and follow the principle of least privilege.
- Easy interface for viewing and managing roles and their associated permissions.
- Regular review and certification of administrator roles and permissions.
- Ability to create custom administrator roles by combining specific permissions.

### 3. Admin Activity Logging & Monitoring
- All significant actions performed by administrators within the admin interface are logged (e.g., user creation, role change, system config update).
- Audit logs for admin activities are secure, tamper-evident, and retained for a defined period.
- Super-administrators can review admin activity logs with filtering and search capabilities.
- Alerts for suspicious or high-risk administrator activities (e.g., multiple failed login attempts, privilege escalation).
- Integration with the main platform audit logging system (Story 10.5).
- Timestamping and attribution (who did what) for all logged admin actions.

### 4. Secure Admin Authentication & Session Management
- Robust authentication mechanisms for administrators accessing the admin portal.
- Secure session management, including session timeouts and protection against session hijacking.
- IP address whitelisting/blacklisting options for accessing the admin portal.
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with corporate identity providers (e.g., Okta, Azure AD) for admin accounts (optional, future enhancement).
- Brute-force protection for admin login interfaces.
- Notification to admins upon successful login from a new device/location.

### 5. User Interface for Admin Management
- A dedicated, secure web interface (Admin Portal) for managing administrator accounts.
- Intuitive UI for super-administrators to perform all admin user management tasks (create, edit, assign roles, view activity).
- Display of current admin users, their roles, status, and last login information.
- Search and filtering capabilities for managing a large number of admin accounts.
- Secure access to the Admin Portal itself, potentially restricted by network or MFA.
- Responsive design for the Admin Portal for accessibility on different devices (if required).

### 6. Policy Enforcement & Compliance
- System enforces defined security policies related to administrator access (e.g., periodic password changes, MFA enforcement).
- Generation of reports for compliance audits regarding administrator access and activity.
- Regular recertification campaigns where administrators' access rights are reviewed and re-approved by super-admins or managers.
- Clear documentation of admin user management policies and procedures.
- Segregation of duties enforced where possible (e.g., an admin cannot approve their own permission changes).

## Technical Guidance

### Backend Implementation (Python/FastAPI)
```python
# API Endpoints (prefixed with /api/v1/admin/platform_users)
POST /api/v1/admin/platform_users/create
PUT /api/v1/admin/platform_users/{admin_user_id}/update
POST /api/v1/admin/platform_users/{admin_user_id}/assign_role
DELETE /api/v1/admin/platform_users/{admin_user_id}/deactivate
GET /api/v1/admin/platform_users/list
GET /api/v1/admin/platform_users/{admin_user_id}/activity_log
POST /api/v1/admin/roles/create
GET /api/v1/admin/roles/list

# Key Functions
async def create_platform_administrator(admin_details, roles)
async def manage_admin_mfa_setup_and_verification()
async def assign_revoke_admin_roles_permissions(admin_user_id, role_ids)
async def log_admin_portal_action(performing_admin_id, target_user_id, action, details)
async def enforce_admin_password_policy(password_attempt)
async def manage_admin_session_security(session_token)
```

### Frontend Implementation (TypeScript/React) - (Admin User Management section in Admin Portal)
```typescript
interface AdminUserManagerDashboard {
  adminUsers: PlatformAdminUser[];
  roles: PlatformAdminRole[];
  selectedUserForEdit: PlatformAdminUser | null;
  userActivityLog: AdminActionLogEntry[];
}

interface PlatformAdminUser {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'suspended';
  roles: string[]; // Role names or IDs
  mfaEnabled: boolean;
  lastLogin: Date;
  createdAt: Date;
}

interface PlatformAdminRole {
  id: string;
  roleName: string;
  description: string;
  permissions: string[]; // List of permission identifiers
}
```

### AI Integration Components
- Anomaly detection for unusual administrator behavior (e.g., logins from strange locations, rapid permission changes).
- AI-assisted suggestions for role definitions based on observed admin activity patterns (long-term future enhancement).
- **Agent Design:** Adhere to principles in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` if any AI agents are involved in monitoring or suggesting admin roles/permissions.

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
CREATE TABLE platform_administrators (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    hashed_password TEXT NOT NULL,
    mfa_secret TEXT, -- Encrypted
    is_mfa_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'active', -- active, inactive, suspended
    is_super_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_login_at TIMESTAMP,
    last_failed_login_at TIMESTAMP,
    failed_login_attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE TABLE platform_admin_roles (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    role_name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    permissions JSONB -- Store list of permission strings, e.g., ["manage_users", "view_system_logs"]
);

CREATE TABLE platform_administrator_role_assignments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    admin_user_id UUID REFERENCES platform_administrators(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    role_id UUID REFERENCES platform_admin_roles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    assigned_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    assigned_by_admin_id UUID REFERENCES platform_administrators(id),
    UNIQUE (admin_user_id, role_id)
);

-- Admin activity log might be part of a broader audit log system (Story 10.5)
-- If separate, it would look like:
CREATE TABLE platform_admin_activity_log (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    performing_admin_id UUID REFERENCES platform_administrators(id),
    action_description TEXT,
    target_resource_type VARCHAR(100), -- e.g., 'User', 'Role', 'SystemSetting'
    target_resource_id VARCHAR(255),
    details JSONB,
    ip_address VARCHAR(45),
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
