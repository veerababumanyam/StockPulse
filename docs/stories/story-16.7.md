## Technical Guidance

### Backend Implementation (Python/FastAPI) - (Primarily policy & process, less code)
```python
# API Endpoints (for managing governance documentation, tracking compliance, etc.)
POST /api/v1/governance/agi-quantum/charter/update
GET /api/v1/governance/agi-quantum/risks/assessment
POST /api/v1/governance/agi-quantum/compliance/report
GET /api/v1/governance/agi-quantum/stakeholder/feedback
POST /api/v1/governance/agi-quantum/foresight/analysis

# Key Functions (representing processes rather than automatable functions)
async def update_governance_charter_documentation()
async def log_risk_assessment_outcome()
async def generate_compliance_attestation_document()
async def collate_stakeholder_feedback_on_ethics()
async def publish_foresight_study_results()
```

### Frontend Implementation (TypeScript/React) - (Internal portal for governance council)
```typescript
interface AGIQuantumGovernancePortal {
  id: string;
  charterDocument: DocumentLink;
  riskRegister: RiskAssessmentEntry[];
  complianceDashboard: ComplianceStatus[];
  stakeholderFeedbackRepo: FeedbackItem[];
  foresightReports: ForesightStudy[];
  councilMeetingMinutes: MeetingMinute[];
}

interface RiskAssessmentEntry {
  riskId: string;
  description: string;
  likelihood: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  impact: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'catastrophic';
  mitigationStrategies: string[];
  status: 'open' | 'mitigated' | 'accepted';
  lastReviewed: Date;
}

interface ComplianceStatus {
  regulationId: string;
  regulationName: string;
  status: 'compliant' | 'pending_review' | 'non_compliant' | 'not_applicable';
  evidenceLinks: DocumentLink[];
  lastAudit: Date;
}

interface ForesightStudy {
  studyId: string;
  title: string;
  publicationDate: Date;
  keyFindings: string[];
  societalImpactAreas: string[];
  recommendations: string[];
}
```

### AI Integration Components (Potentially AI-assisted governance)
- AI for analyzing regulatory texts and identifying compliance gaps
- NLP for processing stakeholder feedback and identifying key themes
- AI for horizon scanning and identifying emerging AGI-quantum risks
- Tools for simulating the impact of different governance policies
- AI-assisted audit trail analysis for ethical compliance
- Knowledge management system for AGI-quantum governance documents and research

### Agent Design Considerations:
- The AGI agents themselves, especially as they become more autonomous or are enhanced by quantum capabilities, are primary subjects of this governance framework. The `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` must be seen as a key technical input and implementation guide for the ethical principles and safety requirements established by the AGI-Quantum Governance Council. The design guide should be regularly updated to reflect new governance policies, risk assessments, and ethical insights pertaining to AGI-quantum symbiosis.
