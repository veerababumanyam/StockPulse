# Story 8.15: Implement Custom Agent Creation Interface for Advanced Users

**Epic:** [Epic 8: Enhanced AI Agents & Intelligence](../epic-8.md)

**Status:** To Do

**Priority:** Medium

**Estimated Effort:** 16 Story Points (4 weeks)

## User Story

**As an** advanced user, quantitative analyst, or institutional client
**I want** to create custom AI agents tailored to my specific investment strategies and analysis requirements
**So that** I can implement proprietary strategies, specialized analysis methods, and unique investment approaches within the StockPulse platform

## Description

Implement a comprehensive custom agent creation interface that allows advanced users to build, configure, and deploy their own AI agents. This system provides a no-code/low-code interface with advanced customization options for creating specialized investment analysis agents.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent Builder Interface

- [ ] **Visual Agent Designer**

  - Drag-and-drop interface for agent component assembly
  - Pre-built agent templates for common use cases
  - Custom data source integration and configuration
  - Agent behavior and decision logic configuration

- [ ] **Advanced Customization Options**
  - Custom strategy implementation with code editor
  - Advanced mathematical and statistical function library
  - Custom risk metrics and performance indicators
  - Machine learning model integration and training

### Agent Deployment and Management

- [ ] **Agent Lifecycle Management**

  - Agent testing and validation sandbox environment
  - Version control and rollback capabilities
  - Performance monitoring and optimization tools
  - Agent collaboration and integration framework

- [ ] **Security and Compliance**
  - Agent access control and permission management
  - Data privacy and security validation
  - Compliance checking for regulatory requirements
  - Audit trail and logging for custom agents

### AG-UI Custom Agent Integration

- [ ] **Voice-Activated Agent Management**
  - Voice commands for agent creation and configuration
  - Natural language agent behavior specification
  - Conversational agent testing and debugging

## Technical Specifications

```typescript
interface CustomAgentBuilder {
  designer: VisualAgentDesigner;
  codeEditor: CodeEditor;
  testingFramework: AgentTestingFramework;
  deployment: AgentDeploymentEngine;
  management: AgentManagementSystem;
}

interface CustomAgent extends BaseAgent {
  definition: AgentDefinition;
  configuration: AgentConfiguration;
  customLogic: CustomLogic;
  dataSources: DataSourceConfiguration[];
  permissions: AgentPermissions;
}
```

```python
class CustomAgentBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.template_library = {}
        self.component_registry = {}
        self.validation_engine = {}

    async def create_custom_agent(self, definition: AgentDefinition) -> CustomAgent:
        """Create custom agent from user definition"""

        # Validate agent definition
        validation_result = await self.validate_definition(definition)
        if not validation_result.is_valid:
            raise ValidationError(validation_result.errors)

        # Build agent components
        agent_components = await self.build_components(definition)

        # Compile and deploy agent
        custom_agent = await self.compile_agent(agent_components)

        return custom_agent
```

### Performance Requirements

- **Agent Creation**: <300 seconds for complex custom agent creation
- **Agent Deployment**: <60 seconds for agent deployment and activation
- **Testing Framework**: <30 seconds for basic agent validation tests
- **Voice Integration**: <5 seconds for voice-activated agent commands

## Business Value

- **Platform Differentiation**: Unique custom agent creation capabilities
- **User Empowerment**: Advanced users can implement proprietary strategies
- **Revenue Growth**: Premium feature for institutional and advanced users
- **Ecosystem Expansion**: Community-driven agent development and sharing

## Success Metrics

- Custom agent creation rate >5 new agents per week per advanced user
- Agent performance satisfaction >85% for custom-built agents
- Platform stickiness >90% retention for users with custom agents
- Community engagement >50% of custom agents shared or collaborated on ðŸš€
