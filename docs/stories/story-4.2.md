# Story 4.2: Develop Stock Detail Page with AI Summary & Real-Time Data

**As a** user (active trader or casual investor),
**I want** to view a detailed page for a selected stock that includes real-time price information, fundamental metrics, company profile, and an AI-generated summary of the stock's key information, recent events, and outlook,
**So that** I can quickly assess the company and make informed investment decisions.

## Description
This story covers the creation of the primary page users will visit to get comprehensive information about a specific stock. The page should be well-organized, easy to read, and combine traditional financial data with AI-powered insights.

Key sections and features include:
-   **Header:** Stock symbol, company name, current price, daily change (value and percentage), and after-hours information if applicable.
-   **AI Summary Section:** A concise, AI-generated overview of the stock. This includes a summary of its current standing, recent significant news, and a brief outlook. This will be powered by the AI Market Insights Agent using RAG.
-   **Charting Area:** Interactive price chart (covered in detail by Story 4.3, but a placeholder/integration point is needed here).
-   **Key Metrics/Fundamentals:** Display of important financial data (e.g., Market Cap, P/E Ratio, EPS, Dividend Yield, 52-week high/low, Volume, Average Volume).
-   **Company Profile:** Brief description of the company, its industry, sector, CEO, headquarters, website, etc.
-   **News Feed:** A section displaying recent news articles related to the stock (covered in detail by Story 4.4, but a placeholder/integration point is needed).
-   **Watchlist Button:** Ability to add/remove the stock from the user's watchlist.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Page Accessibility:** The stock detail page is accessible by navigating from a search result (Story 4.1) or a watchlist, typically via a URL like `/stocks/{symbol}`.
2.  **AC2: Real-Time Price Data:** The page displays the stock's current trading price, daily change (value and percentage), and updates in near real-time (or with a minimal, clearly indicated delay).
3.  **AC3: AI-Generated Summary:** An AI-generated summary section is present, providing a concise overview of the stock. The summary should be clearly attributed to AI.
4.  **AC4: Key Financial Metrics:** Essential financial metrics (as listed in description, configurable list) are displayed accurately.
5.  **AC5: Company Profile Information:** Accurate company profile information (description, industry, sector, etc.) is displayed.
6.  **AC6: Chart Placeholder/Integration:** A designated area for the interactive chart (Story 4.3) is present.
7.  **AC7: News Feed Placeholder/Integration:** A designated area for the news feed (Story 4.4) is present.
8.  **AC8: Watchlist Functionality:** A button allows the user to add the stock to their watchlist if not already added, or remove it if it is. The button status updates correctly.
9.  **AC9: Data Accuracy:** All displayed data (prices, metrics, profile) is accurate and sourced from reliable backend services/APIs.
10. **AC10: UI/UX:** The page is well-structured, information is easy to find, and the design is consistent with the rest of the application. It should be responsive for different screen sizes.
11. **AC11: Loading State:** Clear loading indicators are shown while data is being fetched for different sections of the page.
12. **AC12: Error Handling:** If data for a specific section cannot be loaded, a user-friendly error message is displayed for that section without breaking the entire page.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   Code implemented, reviewed, and merged to the main branch.
-   Unit tests written and passing for key components and data transformations.
-   Integration tests for data fetching and display.
-   AI Market Insights Agent endpoint for the summary is integrated and functional.
-   Backend APIs for price data, metrics, and company profile are integrated.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) has reviewed and approved the page functionality and AI summary.
-   Page is responsive and adheres to design guidelines.

## AI Integration Details

-   **Agent:** AI Market Insights Agent.
-   **Task:** Generate a concise summary of a stock's current standing, recent news, and outlook.
-   **Models:** LLM with RAG capabilities.
-   **Data Sources for AI Summary:** `StockPulse_VectorDB` (populated with company filings, earnings call transcripts, recent news articles, analyst reports), real-time news APIs.
-   **Flow for AI Summary:**
    1.  User navigates to stock detail page for {symbol}.
    2.  Frontend requests AI summary for {symbol} from backend.
    3.  Backend service calls AI Market Insights Agent for {symbol}.
    4.  Agent retrieves relevant documents/data using RAG from `StockPulse_VectorDB` and other sources.
    5.  Agent generates summary and returns it to backend service.
    6.  Backend service sends summary to frontend for display.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Clear visual hierarchy for different sections.
-   Easy-to-read typography and data presentation.
-   Tooltips or info icons for metrics that might need further explanation.
-   Ensure AI-generated content is clearly distinguishable.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 4: Stock Discovery & Analysis](../epic-4.md)
-   Story 4.1 (AI-Enhanced Stock Search) for navigation into this page.
-   Story 4.3 (Interactive Price Charts) - for chart area.
-   Story 4.4 (RAG-Powered News Feed) - for news feed area.
-   AI Market Insights Agent (for summary generation).
-   Backend APIs for market data, financials, company profile.
-   Watchlist API/service.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Defining the exact scope and length of the AI summary to be both informative and concise.
-   Ensuring the freshness and relevance of data used by the RAG process for the AI summary.
-   Performance implications of generating AI summaries on page load; consider caching strategies.
-   Specific list of "Key Metrics" might need refinement based on user feedback.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Performance:** Page should load quickly (e.g., LCP within 2.5 seconds). Real-time data updates should be efficient.
-   **Accuracy:** Financial data and AI summaries must be accurate and up-to-date.
-   **Reliability:** Page should be highly available; individual component failures (e.g., AI summary failing) should not bring down the whole page.
