# Story 14.6: Working Memory & Attention Mechanisms for AGI

**Epic:** Epic 14: AGI Context & Memory Systems
**Story ID:** 14.6
**Story Title:** Working Memory & Attention Mechanisms for AGI
**Assigned to:** AI Research Team, Cognitive Science Team  
**Story Points:** 13

## Business Context
As an AGI developer, I need to implement a sophisticated working memory system with integrated attention mechanisms. This will allow AGI agents to temporarily hold and manipulate information relevant to the current task, focus on the most salient inputs while filtering out distractions, and coordinate information flow between different cognitive processes, which is essential for complex reasoning and fluid interaction.

## User Story
**As an** AGI developer  
**I want to** create a robust working memory system with dynamic attention mechanisms for AGI agents  
**So that** they can effectively manage information for current tasks, focus on relevant data, filter out noise, and enable coherent thought processes and decision-making.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Limited Capacity Working Memory Buffer
- Implementation of a working memory buffer with a functionally limited capacity to hold active information (e.g., pointers to concepts in KG, recent sensory data, intermediate results of computations).
- Mechanisms for rapidly updating the contents of working memory as the AGI's focus shifts.
- Representation of information in working memory in a readily accessible and processable format.
- Decay or displacement of information from working memory when it's no longer attended to or relevant.
- APIs for different AGI cognitive modules (e.g., reasoning, planning, language) to read from and write to working memory.
- Measurement and monitoring of working memory load and capacity utilization.

### 2. Dynamic Attention Allocation
- Implementation of attention mechanisms that can dynamically allocate processing resources to the most relevant information, whether from external senses or internal memory retrieval.
- Both top-down (goal-directed) and bottom-up (stimulus-driven) attention control.
- Ability to focus attention, sustain attention over time, and shift attention flexibly as needed.
- Filtering mechanisms to suppress irrelevant or distracting information.
- Support for selective attention (focusing on one thing) and divided attention (monitoring multiple things, with performance costs).
- Learning mechanisms for optimizing attention allocation strategies over time based on task success.

### 3. Integration with Long-Term Memory Systems
- Seamless interaction between working memory and long-term memory systems (semantic, episodic, procedural - Stories 14.1, 14.4, 14.5).
- Working memory acts as a gateway for encoding new information into long-term memory.
- Retrieval of information from long-term memory into working memory for active processing.
- Attention mechanisms guide the selection of which long-term memories are retrieved into working memory.
- Rehearsal processes within working memory to strengthen traces for long-term encoding.
- Contextual cues in working memory trigger associative retrieval from long-term memory.

### 4. Information Manipulation & Transformation in Working Memory
- Support for manipulating and transforming information held in working memory (e.g., mental rotation, logical inference, symbolic manipulation, sequence rehearsal).
- AGI cognitive operations (e.g., planning, problem-solving) primarily occur on information active in working memory.
- Ability to hold and compare multiple pieces of information simultaneously.
- Scratchpad functionality for intermediate calculations or temporary hypotheses.
- Capacity for binding information from different sources (e.g., linking a visual percept with a semantic concept).
- Role of working memory in language comprehension (e.g., holding sentence structure) and generation.

### 5. Cognitive Load Management & Prioritization
- Mechanisms to monitor and manage the cognitive load imposed by tasks on working memory.
- Prioritization of information and tasks within working memory when capacity limits are approached.
- Strategies for handling cognitive overload (e.g., deferring tasks, simplifying representations, seeking external help).
- Adaptation of processing speed or depth based on available working memory resources.
- Impact of AGI's internal state (e.g., stress, fatigue models) on working memory performance and attention.
- Tools for developers to visualize and debug the contents and flow of information in working memory.

### 6. Attentional Control & Executive Functions
- Implementation of executive functions related to attentional control, such as inhibition (suppressing prepotent responses), task switching, and updating working memory contents.
- Goal-directed modulation of attention to focus on task-relevant features.
- Monitoring for conflicts or errors in information processing within working memory.
- Role of working memory in supporting meta-cognition (AGI thinking about its own thinking processes).
- Development of AGI's ability to intentionally direct its attention.
- Training paradigms for improving AGI's attentional control and executive functions.

### AI Integration Components
- Neural network architectures with attention mechanisms (e.g., Transformers, LSTMs with attention).
- Global Workspace Theory (GWT) inspired architectures.
- Symbolic AI components for manipulation within working memory.
- Reinforcement learning for learning attention policies.
- Computational models of executive functions.
- High-speed, low-latency data structures for working memory buffers (e.g., Redis, in-memory caches).
- **Agent Design:** The working memory capacity, attention control strategies, and the integration of these with other cognitive functions are key design considerations for AGI agents, as per `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md`.

### Database Schema Updates (Primarily in-memory or fast cache; logs for analysis)
```sql
-- Working memory is typically too dynamic for traditional DBs;
-- this schema is more for logging/analyzing its behavior.
CREATE TABLE agi_working_memory_snapshots (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    agent_id VARCHAR(100),
    active_items JSONB, -- Snapshot of items in WM
    attention_focus JSONB, -- What was being attended to
    cognitive_load_estimate DECIMAL,
    current_task_id VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE agi_attention_shifts_log (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),

    previous_focus JSONB,
    new_focus JSONB,
    trigger_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'goal_directed', 'stimulus_driven'
    reason TEXT
);
```
