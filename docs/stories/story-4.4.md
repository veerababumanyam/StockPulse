# Story 4.4: Display RAG-Powered News & Research Feed with AI Summaries

**As a** user (active trader or casual investor),
**I want** to see a feed of recent news articles, analyst reports, and press releases related to a selected stock on its detail page, with AI-generated summaries and sentiment indicators for each item, and the ability to ask clarifying questions about the content,
**So that** I can stay efficiently informed about events and opinions affecting the stock and understand their potential impact.

## Description
This story focuses on integrating a dynamic, AI-enhanced news and research feed into the Stock Detail Page (Story 4.2). The feed will leverage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to pull relevant content and provide AI-driven insights like summaries and sentiment analysis. It also introduces an interactive element allowing users to ask questions about the displayed content.

Key features include:
-   Display of a chronological or relevance-sorted list of news items (articles, press releases, analyst report snippets) related to the current stock.
-   For each news item:
    -   Source and publication date.
    -   Headline/Title.
    -   An AI-generated summary of the news item.
    -   An AI-determined sentiment indicator (e.g., positive, neutral, negative).
    -   A link to the original source article/document.
-   Ability for the user to ask clarifying questions about a specific news item or its summary, with answers generated by an AI agent using RAG.
-   Option to filter the feed (e.g., by news type, sentiment - future enhancement, basic for now).
-   "Load more" functionality for long feeds.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Feed Display:** A news and research feed is displayed within the designated area on the Stock Detail Page (Story 4.2) for the selected stock.
2.  **AC2: Content Relevance:**Displayed items are relevant to the specific stock being viewed.
3.  **AC3: AI Summary per Item:** Each news item in the feed includes a concise, AI-generated summary.
4.  **AC4: AI Sentiment per Item:** Each news item displays an AI-determined sentiment indicator (e.g., using icons/colors for positive/neutral/negative).
5.  **AC5: Source Link:** Each item provides a clickable link to the original source.
6.  **AC6: Data Freshness:** The feed displays reasonably up-to-date news items.
7.  **AC7: Interactive Q&A (Basic):** Users can select a news item and ask a simple clarifying question (e.g., via a text input). The system provides an AI-generated answer based on the context of that news item.
8.  **AC8: UI/UX:** The feed is easy to read, summaries are clearly distinguishable, and sentiment is intuitive. The Q&A interface is user-friendly.
9.  **AC9: Loading and Pagination:** Appropriate loading indicators are shown. If the feed is long, a "load more" or pagination mechanism is implemented.
10. **AC10: Error Handling:** If the news feed or AI summaries cannot be loaded, a user-friendly error message is displayed.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   Code implemented, reviewed, and merged to the main branch.
-   Unit tests for feed components, AI summary/sentiment display, and Q&A interaction.
-   Integration tests for the end-to-end news feed functionality, including RAG pipeline and AI agent responses.
-   AI Market Insights Agent (or specialized sub-agent) endpoints for news aggregation, summarization, sentiment analysis, and RAG-based Q&A are integrated and functional.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) has reviewed and approved the functionality.
-   Feed is responsive and adheres to design guidelines.

## AI Integration Details

-   **Agent:** AI Market Insights Agent (or a specialized News/Research sub-agent).
-   **Tasks:**
    -   Aggregate relevant news/research items for a given stock.
    -   Generate summaries for each item using LLMs.
    -   Determine sentiment for each item using NLP models.
    -   Answer user questions about specific news items using RAG (retrieving from the content of the specific item or closely related context).
-   **Models:** LLMs for summarization and Q&A, NLP models for sentiment analysis.
-   **Data Sources:** `StockPulse_VectorDB` (pre-populated and continuously updated with news articles, press releases, analyst reports, filings), external News APIs.
-   **Flow for Feed Display & Summaries:**
    1.  User views stock detail page for {symbol}.
    2.  Frontend requests news feed for {symbol}.
    3.  Backend service calls AI Agent.
    4.  AI Agent queries `StockPulse_VectorDB` and/or News APIs for recent relevant items.
    5.  For each item, Agent generates summary and sentiment.
    6.  Agent returns a list of news items with summaries and sentiments to backend.
    7.  Backend sends data to frontend for display.
-   **Flow for Interactive Q&A:**
    1.  User asks a question about a specific news item.
    2.  Frontend sends question and context (e.g., news item ID or content) to backend.
    3.  Backend calls AI Agent with question and context.
    4.  Agent uses RAG (focused on the provided news item context) to generate an answer.
    5.  Agent returns answer to backend.
    6.  Backend sends answer to frontend.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Clear separation between news items.
-   Easy-to-scan summaries.
-   Intuitive sentiment indicators.
-   Non-intrusive Q&A interface associated with each item.
-   Links to sources should open in a new tab/window.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 4: Stock Discovery & Analysis](../epic-4.md)
-   Stock Detail Page (Story 4.2) - as the host for this feed.
-   AI Market Insights Agent (or sub-agent) with capabilities for news aggregation, RAG, summarization, sentiment analysis, and Q&A.
-   Populated `StockPulse_VectorDB` with relevant news/research content.
-   Access to external News APIs if used for fetching fresh content.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Defining the scope and complexity of the initial Q&A functionality (e.g., how deep should the RAG search be for answers).
-   Managing the ingestion pipeline for `StockPulse_VectorDB` to ensure data freshness and relevance for news.
-   Accuracy and potential biases of AI-generated summaries and sentiment indicators.
-   Latency of AI responses, especially for Q&A.
-   Cost implications of using LLMs for summarization and Q&A for every news item/interaction.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Performance:** Feed should load quickly. AI summaries should appear without excessive delay. Q&A responses should be reasonably timed.
-   **Accuracy:** AI Summaries should accurately reflect the core message of the source. Sentiment should be generally appropriate.
-   **Scalability:** The system should handle news feeds for many stocks and users.
