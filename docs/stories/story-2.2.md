# Story 2.2: Implement Customizable Widget System for Dashboard

**Epic:** [Dashboard Core Functionality](../epic-2.md)
**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** High
**Points:** 8 (Estimate)
**Assigned To:** Frontend Dev Agent (Rodney)
**Sprint:** TBD

## Summary

Implement a customizable widget system for the dashboard that allows users to add, remove, and rearrange widgets according to their preferences. The system should support drag-and-drop functionality, persist user configurations, and provide a default layout for new users.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1:** Users can enter an "edit mode" to customize their dashboard
- [ ] **AC2:** Users can select from a library of available widgets to add to their dashboard
- [ ] **AC3:** Users can drag and drop widgets to different positions on the dashboard
- [ ] **AC4:** Users can resize widgets (where applicable)
- [ ] **AC5:** Users can remove widgets from their dashboard
- [ ] **AC6:** Widget configurations are persisted to the backend and associated with the user account
- [ ] **AC7:** When users load the dashboard, their saved configuration is loaded and rendered
- [ ] **AC8:** New users receive a sensible default layout

## Technical Requirements

- [ ] Use React Grid Layout for the grid system
- [ ] Implement responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Store widget configurations in the backend database
- [ ] Support for future widget types with minimal code changes
- [ ] Proper error handling and loading states
- [ ] TypeScript implementation with proper type safety

### Technical Implementation Plan

**Architecture Decisions:**
- React-grid-layout for drag-and-drop functionality
- TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- Tailwind CSS for consistent styling and responsive design
- Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions
- Recharts for financial data visualization
- Comprehensive error boundaries and loading states

**Performance Considerations:**
- Lazy loading of individual widget components
- React.memo and useMemo for preventing unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient grid layout calculations
- Optimized bundle splitting for widget components
- Responsive image loading and asset optimization

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management in edit mode
- Semantic HTML structure throughout

**Mobile-First Design:**
- Responsive breakpoints: xxs(0), xs(480), sm(768), md(996), lg(1200)
- Touch-friendly interface with appropriate sizing
- Optimized layouts for all screen sizes
- Progressive enhancement approach

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit Tests: Target 95%+ coverage for all components and hooks
- Integration Tests: Target 90%+ coverage for widget system flows
- E2E Tests: Target 85%+ coverage for user workflows
