# Story 5.4: Develop Open Orders Management View

**As a** user (active trader),
**I want** a dedicated page or section where I can see all my currently open (active/pending) orders with their real-time status, and have options to attempt to modify or cancel them,
**So that** I can effectively manage my trading activity before orders are fully executed.

## Description
This story focuses on providing users with a clear and actionable view of their orders that have been submitted but not yet fully executed or otherwise completed. It allows for tracking and intervention (modification/cancellation where permissible).

Key features include:
-   Fetching and displaying a list of all open/active orders for the user.
-   Displaying key order details: Symbol, Action (Buy/Sell), Quantity (original/remaining), Order Type, Limit/Stop Prices, Current Status (real-time update via Story 5.6), Submitted Timestamp.
-   "Modify Order" functionality: For orders in a modifiable state, allowing changes to parameters like limit price or quantity, followed by a confirmation step. This may reuse or adapt the Order Entry Form.
-   "Cancel Order" functionality: For orders in a cancellable state, requiring user confirmation.
-   Real-time (or near real-time) updates to the status of orders in the list.
-   Clear loading states and error handling for fetching orders and processing actions.
-   A message if the user has no open orders.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Display Open Orders:** When the user navigates to the open orders view, a list of their open/active orders is displayed with essential details (Symbol, Action, Type, Quantity, Price(s), Status, Submitted At).
2.  **AC2: Modify Order Functionality:** If an order is modifiable, a "Modify" option is available. Selecting it allows the user to change permissible parameters (e.g., price, quantity) and, after confirmation, submits the modification request to the backend.
3.  **AC3: Cancel Order Functionality:** If an order is cancellable, a "Cancel" option is available. Selecting it (after user confirmation) submits a cancellation request to the backend.
4.  **AC4: Feedback on Actions (Success):** Upon successful backend processing of a modification or cancellation, the order list updates to reflect the change (e.g., modified parameters, status change to "Cancelled"), and a success notification is shown.
5.  **AC5: Feedback on Actions (Failure):** If a backend modification or cancellation request fails (e.g., order already filled, market closed, broker rejection), an appropriate error message is displayed, and the list remains (or updates to reflect the reason for failure if possible).
6.  **AC6: Loading/Empty States:** Appropriate loading indicators are shown while fetching or processing. A clear message is shown if there are no open orders.
7.  **AC7: Real-time Status Updates:** The status of orders in the list should update in near real-time as changes occur (leveraging Story 5.6).

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   UI for displaying open orders and initiating modify/cancel actions is implemented.
-   Backend API integrations for fetching open orders, modifying, and cancelling are functional.
-   Logic for handling different order states (modifiable, cancellable) is implemented.
-   Success and error handling for all actions are robust.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and unit/integration tests passed.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) has reviewed and approved the functionality.

## AI Integration Details

-   **Note:** Direct AI analysis or suggestions within this specific view are not the primary focus of this story. However, this view will display orders that may have been influenced by AI insights during their creation (e.g., Story 5.1, 5.2). The accuracy of displaying data for such orders is important.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Clear, scannable list or table for orders.
-   Intuitive placement and design for Modify/Cancel actions.
-   Unambiguous confirmation dialogues for cancellation.
-   Real-time status updates should be noticeable but not distracting.

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 5: Trading & Order Management](../epic-5.md)
-   Backend Order Management Service API for fetching open orders (`GET /api/v1/orders?status=OPEN`), modifying (`PUT /api/v1/orders/{orderId}`), and cancelling (`DELETE /api/v1/orders/{orderId}`).
-   Story 5.6 (Implement Real-time Order Status Updates & Notifications) for live status updates in the list.
-   Potentially components from Order Entry (Stories 5.1, 5.2) if reused for modification.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Definitive list of order statuses considered "open" and those that are modifiable/cancellable (depends on brokerage and exchange rules).
-   Handling of modification/cancellation for partially filled orders.
-   Complexity of the "Modify Order" form if it needs to cater to all order types and their specific editable fields.
-   Synchronization between this view and real-time notifications (Story 5.6).

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Performance:** The list of open orders should load quickly. Actions should be responsive.
-   **Accuracy:** Displayed order information and statuses must be accurate and timely.
-   **Reliability:** Modify/cancel actions must be reliably processed by the backend.
