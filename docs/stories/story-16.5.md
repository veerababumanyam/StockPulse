### Agent Design Considerations:
- AI agents that consume or contribute to quantum simulations of financial systems must be designed to handle the complexity and specific output formats of these simulations. For instance, risk management agents might use quantum systemic risk simulations, or trading strategy agents might leverage quantum ABM insights. The design of such agents must follow the guidelines in `docs/ai/agent-design-guide.md` to ensure they can effectively integrate quantum simulation results into their decision-making processes.
