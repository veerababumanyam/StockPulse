# Story 8.5: Develop AI Agent for Deep Fundamental Analysis & Insights Generation (Earnings Calls, Filings)

**As a** user (fundamental analyst or investor),
**I want** an AI agent that can perform deep analysis of company fundamentals by processing SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q), earnings call transcripts, and financial statements,
**So that** I can quickly understand a company's financial health, identify key themes, risks, management sentiment, and comparative performance insights without manually sifting through dense documents.

## Description
This story focuses on creating an "AI Fundamental Insights Agent" capable of advanced NLP tasks on financial documents. It significantly extends the basic fundamental data integration in Story 6.5.

Key features include:
-   **Earnings Call Transcript Analysis:**
    *   Ingest and process earnings call transcripts.
    *   Perform sentiment analysis on management discussion and Q&A sections.
    *   Identify key topics, promises, concerns, and forward-looking statements.
    *   Summarize key takeaways from earnings calls.
-   **SEC Filing Analysis (10-K, 10-Q):**
    *   Extract key information from sections like Risk Factors, Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A).
    *   Identify changes in language or emphasis across periodic filings (e.g., new risk factors).
    *   Potentially flag unusual or complex language.
-   **Financial Statement Insights:**
    *   Analyze trends in financial statements (e.g., revenue growth, margin changes, debt levels).
    *   Calculate and interpret key financial ratios beyond basic ones.
    *   Provide AI-generated textual summaries of financial performance and health.
-   **Comparative Analysis:**
    *   Compare a company's fundamentals (e.g., key ratios, growth rates, sentiment from calls) against its historical performance and key competitors.
-   **AI Integration - AI Fundamental Insights Agent:**
    *   Utilizes NLP models (e.g., LLMs, transformers fine-tuned on financial text) for summarization, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and information extraction.
    *   Leverages `StockPulse_VectorDB` for RAG on filings and transcripts.
-   Presentation of insights in a structured and digestible format (e.g., dashboards, reports, interactive Q&A with the agent about a specific document).

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Earnings Call Summarization & Sentiment:** The AI agent can process an earnings call transcript for a selected company, provide a summary of key themes, and assign sentiment scores to management commentary and Q&A.
2.  **AC2: SEC Filing Key Insights (MD&A, Risk Factors):** The agent can extract and summarize key points or changes from the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of the latest 10-K or 10-Q for a selected company.
3.  **AC3: Financial Trend Summary:** The agent can generate a brief textual summary highlighting key trends observed in a company's core financial statements (Income, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow) over the last 3-5 periods.
4.  **AC4: Basic Peer Comparison:** The agent can present a comparison of 2-3 key financial ratios (e.g., P/E, Debt-to-Equity) for a selected company against the average of 2-3 named competitors.
5.  **AC5: AI Agent Backend:** The AI Fundamental Insights Agent backend performs all NLP processing and insight generation.
6.  **AC6: Insight Presentation:** Generated insights (summaries, sentiment, key findings) are presented clearly in the UI.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   The AI Fundamental Insights Agent is functional, providing the specified analyses for selected companies.
-   NLP models are performing adequately for summarization, sentiment, and basic extraction.
-   Insights are presented in a user-friendly manner.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and relevant tests passed (including NLP model evaluation).
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) and a sample fundamental analyst user have validated the usefulness and clarity of the generated insights.

## AI Integration Details

-   **AI Fundamental Insights Agent:**
    *   Core NLP/NLU work. Requires expertise in fine-tuning LLMs or using specialized financial NLP models.
    *   Heavy reliance on RAG with data ingested in Story 6.5 (fundamentals, filings) and stored in `StockPulse_VectorDB` and `StockPulse_PostgreSQL`.
    *   Tasks include: Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, text summarization, topic modeling, question answering over documents.

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Present complex financial information and NLP-derived insights in an easily understandable way.
-   Allow users to drill down from summaries to source documents or specific data points.
-   Clearly indicate the source of information and the AI's confidence if applicable.
-   Provide options for users to ask follow-up questions or refine the analysis (future).

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 8: Advanced Analytics & Insights](../epic-8.md)
-   Story 6.5 (Implement Company Fundamental Data Integration) for access to financial statements, filings, and potentially earnings transcripts.
-   `StockPulse_VectorDB` setup and populated with embeddings of financial documents.
-   Story 6.9 (Internal Data Access API Layer).
-   Story 7.7 (AI Meta-Agent/Orchestrator Backend) for managing the AI Fundamental Insights Agent.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Accuracy and reliability of NLP models on complex financial texts (e.g., nuanced language in MD&A).
-   Handling diverse formats and structures of financial documents.
-   Computational cost of processing large volumes of text data.
-   Keeping up with changes in reporting standards or company-specific jargon.
-   Potential for AI to misinterpret or oversimplify complex financial situations â€“ transparency is key.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Accuracy of Insights:** While subjective, AI-generated summaries and analyses should be factually grounded and reflect the source documents accurately.
-   **Processing Speed:** Analysis of new documents should be completed in a reasonable timeframe.
-   **Scalability:** System should handle analysis for a growing number of companies and documents.
-   **Traceability:** Users should be able to trace insights back to source information in documents.
