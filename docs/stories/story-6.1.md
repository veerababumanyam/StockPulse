# Story 6.1: Implement Real-Time Equity Price/Volume Data Feed Integration (e.g., IEX Cloud)

**As a** system (StockPulse platform and its AI agents),
**I need** to connect to and consume real-time equity price and volume data feeds from a primary provider (e.g., IEX Cloud),
**So that** users can see live market prices, AI agents can perform real-time analysis, and trading operations can be based on current data.

## Description
This story involves establishing a connection to a selected real-time market data provider for US equities (IEX Cloud is an example, actual provider may vary based on cost, coverage, and API quality). It includes fetching live price quotes, trade data (last sale), and volume information, and making this data available to other platform services.

Key features include:
-   Securely connect to the chosen data provider's real-time streaming API (e.g., WebSocket or SSE).
-   Subscribe to a relevant set of US equity symbols (initially, could be S&P 500, or based on user demand/activity).
-   Process incoming data messages for trades, quotes (bid/ask), and volume.
-   Normalize the received data into a standard internal format.
-   Publish normalized real-time data to an internal stream or message bus (e.g., Kafka, Redis Streams) for consumption by other services (e.g., UI updates, AI analysis).
-   Initial storage of this raw or near-raw feed into a staging area within `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB` for immediate availability and later processing (aggregation, etc. by Story 6.2).
-   Robust error handling, connection management (reconnect logic), and monitoring for the data feed.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **AC1: Successful Connection & Authentication:** The system can successfully connect and authenticate with the chosen real-time equity data provider's API.
2.  **AC2: Data Reception:** The system receives a continuous stream of real-time data (trades, quotes, volume) for subscribed equity symbols.
3.  **AC3: Data Normalization:** Incoming data is correctly parsed and transformed into a predefined standard internal schema.
4.  **AC4: Internal Publication:** Normalized real-time data is published to an internal message bus/stream, accessible by other platform components.
5.  **AC5: Initial Time-Series Storage:** Real-time data points are written to `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB` with correct timestamps and metadata (symbol, data type).
6.  **AC6: Error Handling & Resilience:** The connection handles transient errors gracefully, attempts to reconnect if disconnected, and logs critical issues.
7.  **AC7: Monitoring:** Basic monitoring is in place for data feed health (e.g., message rate, connection status, error rates).

## Definition of Done (DoD)

-   All Acceptance Criteria met.
-   Real-time data feed integration with the chosen provider is operational.
-   Data is flowing, normalized, published internally, and stored in the time-series database.
-   Connection management and basic monitoring are implemented.
-   Code reviewed, merged, and unit/integration tests passed.
-   Product Owner (Jimmy) has confirmed data is accessible and appears correct for sample symbols.

## AI Integration Details

-   **Note:** This story provides the raw material for AI. The AI agents themselves don't directly integrate here, but they are primary consumers of the data produced.
-   AI can be used in future stories to monitor the quality/anomalies of this incoming real-time feed (see Story 6.8).

## UI/UX Considerations

-   Not directly a UI story, but this enables real-time price updates in the UI (handled in other epics/stories).

## Dependencies

-   [Epic 6: Data Sources & Market Integration](../epic-6.md)
-   `StockPulse_TimeSeriesDB` schema and write access configured.
-   Internal message bus/streaming infrastructure (e.g., Kafka, Redis) setup.
-   API key and subscription for the chosen data provider (e.g., IEX Cloud).
-   Defined internal data schema for real-time market data.

## Open Questions/Risks

-   Final selection of the primary real-time equity data provider (IEX Cloud is an example; cost, reliability, terms of service, and data coverage need evaluation).
-   Specific API (WebSocket, SSE, FIX) to be used and its characteristics.
-   Scope of initial symbols to subscribe to (e.g., all US equities, S&P 500, dynamically based on activity).
-   Data rate limits and potential costs associated with high-volume data consumption.
-   Latency considerations for real-time data propagation within the platform.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Timeliness:** Data must be as close to real-time as the provider allows.
-   **Accuracy:** Data must accurately reflect market activity.
-   **Reliability:** The data feed connection must be stable and resilient.
-   **Scalability:** Should handle a large number of symbols and high message rates, and be able to scale with platform growth.
