# Story 1.2: Implement User Login Flow

**Epic:** [Core User Authentication and Account Setup](../epic-1.md)
**Status:** Draft
**Priority:** High
**Points:** (Estimate)
**Assigned To:**
**Sprint:**

## 1. User Story

> As an existing user,
> I want to be able to log in to my StockPulse account using my email and password,
> So that I can access my portfolio and trading tools.

## 2. Requirements

- Provide a user login form accessible via a dedicated route (e.g., `/login`).
- The form must collect:
  - Email address
  - Password
- Implement client-side validation for:
  - Email format (must be a valid email structure).
  - Password (must not be empty).
- On form submission, securely transmit user credentials to the backend login API endpoint.
- Upon successful login (as indicated by the backend API):
  - Store session information using **HttpOnly cookies** (confirmed security strategy).
  - Redirect the user to their main dashboard (e.g., `/dashboard`).
- Display clear, user-friendly error messages for:
  - Client-side validation failures.
  - API-side errors (e.g., invalid credentials, account locked, server error).
- Input field for password should obscure the entered text.
- Include a "Forgot Password?" link (functionality to be implemented in a separate story).

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  **AC1:** Given a user is on the login page (`/login`), when they enter their correct registered email and password and submit the form, then the login is successful via the backend API, session information is stored in HttpOnly cookies, and the user is redirected to the dashboard page (`/dashboard`).
2.  **AC2:** Given a user is on the login page, when they attempt to submit the form with an invalid email format, then a client-side validation error message is displayed for the email field, and the form is not submitted.
3.  **AC3:** Given a user is on the login page, when they attempt to submit the form with an empty password field, then a client-side validation error message is displayed for the password field, and the form is not submitted.
4.  **AC4:** Given a user attempts to log in with an incorrect email or password, when the form is submitted, then an appropriate error message (e.g., "Invalid email or password.") is displayed, sourced from the backend API response.
5.  **AC5:** Given a user is on the login page, the password input field must obscure the characters as they are typed.
6.  **AC6:** Given any server-side error occurs during the login API call (other than invalid credentials), then a generic but user-friendly error message (e.g., "Login failed. Please try again later.") is displayed.
7.  **AC7:** A "Forgot Password?" link is visible on the login page, though it may initially link to a placeholder page or show a "Coming Soon" message until the password reset feature (Story 1.x) is implemented.
8.  **AC8:** Given a successful login, the AuthContext is updated with user information without storing JWT tokens in localStorage or sessionStorage.
9.  **AC9:** Given a user attempts to access the application after login, the authentication state is determined by API calls rather than client-side token inspection.

## 4. Technical Guidance for Developer Agent

### 4.1 Confirmed Architectural Decisions

- **JWT Storage Strategy:** HttpOnly cookies with the following configuration:
  - `HttpOnly: true` - Prevents XSS access to tokens
  - `Secure: true` - HTTPS only transmission
  - `SameSite: Strict` - CSRF protection
  - `Max-Age: 1800` - 30-minute expiration
- **Backend Framework:** FastAPI with fastapi-mcp integration
- **Frontend State Management:** React AuthContext without localStorage token storage

### 4.2 Backend Technical Specifications

- **Framework Setup:**

  ```python
  from fastapi import FastAPI
  from fastapi_mcp import FastApiMCP

  app = FastAPI()
  mcp = FastApiMCP(app)
  ```

- **JWT Configuration:**

  - Algorithm: RS256 (asymmetric encryption)
  - Access Token Lifetime: 30 minutes
  - Refresh Token Lifetime: 7 days
  - Token Claims: user_id, email, exp, iat

- **API Endpoints:**

  - `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - User authentication with HttpOnly cookie response
  - `GET /api/v1/auth/me` - Current user information (for auth state checking)
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` - Session termination with cookie clearing
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` - Token refresh endpoint

- **Expected Request/Response:**
  ```json
  // POST /api/v1/auth/login
  Request: { "email": "user@example.com", "password": "Password123!" }
  Success Response (200): {
      "user": { "id": "uuid", "email": "...", "name": "..." },
      "message": "Login successful"
  }
  // HttpOnly cookie set in response headers
  Error Response (401): { "error": "Invalid email or password" }
  ```

### 4.3 Frontend Technical Specifications

- **Key Components/Modules:**

  - New Page: `src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx`
  - New Components: `src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`
  - Service: `src/services/authService.ts` with cookie-based session management
  - Context: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` for authentication state without token storage
  - API Client: Configure with `withCredentials: true` for automatic cookie handling

- **AuthContext Implementation:**

  ```typescript
  interface AuthContextType {
    user: User | null;
    loading: boolean;
    login: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
    logout: () => Promise<void>;
    isAuthenticated: boolean;
  }
  ```

- **API Client Configuration:**
  ```typescript
  const apiClient = axios.create({
    baseURL: "http://localhost:8000/api/v1",
    withCredentials: true, // Essential for HttpOnly cookies
    timeout: 10000,
  });
  ```

### 4.4 Security Implementation Requirements

- **CORS Configuration:**

  ```python
  app.add_middleware(
      CORSMiddleware,
      allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000"],
      allow_credentials=True,
      allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
      allow_headers=["*"],
  )
  ```

- **Rate Limiting:** Implement 5 login attempts per minute per IP address
- **Input Validation:** Server-side validation with Pydantic models
- **Password Security:** Bcrypt hashing with salt rounds ≥ 12

### 4.5 MCP Agent Integration

- **Authentication Events:** Trigger MCP notifications on successful login/logout
- **User Context Propagation:** Send user preferences to relevant agents
- **Agent Authentication:** Validate user context in agent requests

### 4.6 Database Requirements

- **Users Table:** id, email, password_hash, is_active, failed_login_attempts, locked_until
- **User Sessions Table:** session_token, refresh_token_hash, expires_at, ip_address, user_agent
- **Auth Audit Log:** event_type, user_id, ip_address, success, details, timestamp
